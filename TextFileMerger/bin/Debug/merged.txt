***Beginning of Mr. Robot S01E01.srt
1
00:00:00,899 --> 00:00:01,835
Hello, friend.

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:03,841
Hello, friend?

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,243
That's lame.

4
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:07,439
Maybe I should give you a name,

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,111
but that's a slippery slope.

6
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:10,023
You're only in my head.

7
00:00:10,024 --> 00:00:11,947
We have to remember that.

8
00:00:12,471 --> 00:00:13,728
Shit.

9
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:14,610
It's actually happened,

10
00:00:14,611 --> 00:00:16,722
I'm talking to an imaginary person.

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:19,600
What I'm about to tell you

12
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:20,939
is top secret,

13
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:24,038
a conspiracy bigger than all of us.

14
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:26,562
There's a powerful
group of people out there

15
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,602
that are secretly running the world.

16
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:32,234
I'm talking about the
guys no one knows about,

17
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,082
the guys that are invisible.

18
00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:38,419
The top 1% of the top
1%, the guys that play God

19
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,236
without permission.

20
00:00:42,499 --> 00:00:44,447
And now I think they're following me.

21
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:55,491
This is about last night.

22
00:00:55,492 --> 00:00:58,048
I should've gone to
Angela's birthday party.

23
00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:00,699
Instead, I went to...

24
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:14,049
Hey, Ron.

25
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,503
There you go.

26
00:01:51,699 --> 00:01:53,699
You're Ron.

27
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,936
But your real name is Rohit Mehta.

28
00:02:00,937 --> 00:02:02,719
You changed it to Ron when you bought

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,224
your first Ron's Coffee Shop

30
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,906
six years ago.

31
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:09,745
Now you got 17 of 'em with
8 more coming next quarter.

32
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:14,566
May I help you with something?

33
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,002
I like coming here 'cause
your Wi-Fi was fast.

34
00:02:18,003 --> 00:02:19,141
I mean, you're one of the few spots

35
00:02:19,142 --> 00:02:21,911
that has a fiber connection
with gigabit speed.

36
00:02:21,912 --> 00:02:23,213
It's good.

37
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:27,177
So good, it scratched
that part of my mind, part

38
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:30,938
that doesn't allow good
to exist without condition,

39
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:33,602
so I started intercepting all the traffic

40
00:02:33,603 --> 00:02:34,872
on your network.

41
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,160
That's when I noticed something strange.

42
00:02:38,212 --> 00:02:40,915
It's when I decided to hack you.

43
00:02:41,899 --> 00:02:43,683
- Hack...
- I know you run a website

44
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:46,213
- called Plato's Boys.
- Pardon me?

45
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:48,899
You're using Tor networking
to keep the servers anonymous.

46
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,950
You made it really hard

47
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:52,708
for anyone to see it, but I saw it.

48
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:54,617
The onion routing protocol,

49
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:56,899
it's not as anonymous as you think it is.

50
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,899
Whoever's in control of the exit nodes

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,899
is also in control of the traffic,

52
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,677
which makes me...

53
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:04,899
the one in control.

54
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:08,899
I must ask you to kindly leave.

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,834
I own everything. All your emails.

56
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:13,398
All your files.

57
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:14,899
All your... pics.

58
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:20,240
Get out of here right now,

59
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,054
- or I'll call the...
- Police?

60
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:23,098
You want them to find out

61
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,339
about the 100 terabytes
of child pornography

62
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,691
you serve to your 400,000 users?

63
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,017
Personally, man, I was

64
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,700
hoping it was just gonna be

65
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:34,524
some BDSM stuff.

66
00:03:35,013 --> 00:03:37,787
You realize how much
simpler that would have been?

67
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:45,199
I did not hurt anyone.

68
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,199
I never did.

69
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,034
That's my...

70
00:03:54,035 --> 00:03:55,597
personal life.

71
00:03:59,699 --> 00:04:02,779
I understand what it's like

72
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,829
to be different.

73
00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:09,607
I'm very different too.

74
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:14,412
I mean, I don't jerk off
to little kids, but...

75
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:18,150
I don't know how to talk to people.

76
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:21,799
My dad was the only one I could talk to.

77
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,499
But he died.

78
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm sorry to hear that.

79
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,138
- How did he pass, may I ask?
- Leukemia.

80
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,985
He definitely got it from
radiation at the company

81
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:46,233
he worked at, though I couldn't prove it.

82
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,659
Now he's dead.

83
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,000
Company's fine, though.

84
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,870
Oh... hey.

85
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,799
It's okay, Rohit.

86
00:05:02,799 --> 00:05:05,067
You don't have to worry anymore.

87
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,999
I don't understand.

88
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:11,900
Are you blackmailing me?

89
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,678
So that's what this is about...

90
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,600
money.

91
00:05:17,601 --> 00:05:20,737
That's all you care about, huh?

92
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:23,399
No.

93
00:05:24,799 --> 00:05:26,266
If I pay you now,

94
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:28,173
you'll want more and more.

95
00:05:28,174 --> 00:05:30,426
No matter how much I give.

96
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,799
You will inform the police anyway.

97
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,799
I won't pay you, sir.

98
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:41,139
Remember, you also broke the law.

99
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,099
Actually, you're right.

100
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,909
Partly.

101
00:05:47,816 --> 00:05:50,682
See, I usually do this kind
of thing from my computer,

102
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,878
but this time I wanted to do it AFK.

103
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,799
In person.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,061
Trying to work on my social anxiety.

105
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:00,434
But there's always the
threat of you fleeing

106
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:01,810
after I call you out.

107
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:05,045
You'd tell your sys admin
to take your servers down,

108
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:06,346
wipe all the data.

109
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:09,838
So I made sure to include the current time

110
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:13,088
and... and location on my anonymous tip.

111
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:14,795
Wait. Hold on. I'll give you the money.

112
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:15,848
I'll pay you.

113
00:06:15,849 --> 00:06:17,709
How much do you want? I'll pay you.

114
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:21,255
That's the part you
were wrong about, Rohit.

115
00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:24,543
I don't give a shit about money.

116
00:06:36,834 --> 00:06:38,830
Now I'm being followed.

117
00:06:45,161 --> 00:06:47,168
The higher ups don't like
someone with my powers.

118
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,862
In three short minutes, I
destroyed a man's business,

119
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:51,337
life, existence.

120
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:53,692
- I deleted him.
- Hey!

121
00:06:54,723 --> 00:06:57,367
Hey, you. Hey, kiddo.

122
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,613
What's happening?

123
00:07:05,704 --> 00:07:08,083
Exciting time in the world right now.

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,051
Exciting time.

125
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,621
But I'm only a vigilante hacker by night.

126
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,626
By day, just a regular
cyber security engineer,

127
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:43,232
employee number ER28-0652.

128
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:46,072
Elliot!

129
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:49,081
In here.

130
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:54,099
- What's up?
- El.

131
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,672
All over the price...
Yeah, I can totally...

132
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:03,979
I can totally handle it.

133
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,986
They were hacked again last night.

134
00:08:07,143 --> 00:08:08,015
Gideon...

135
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:09,711
That's my childhood friend Angela.

136
00:08:09,712 --> 00:08:11,734
She can be a bit high strung sometimes,

137
00:08:11,735 --> 00:08:13,849
but trust me... she's one of the good ones.

138
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:14,976
What am I looking at?

139
00:08:14,977 --> 00:08:17,508
Is this the log file?
This was a RUDY attack.

140
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:19,185
This is awesome.

141
00:08:19,186 --> 00:08:20,711
- Gideon, will you answer me?
- Awesome?

142
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:23,198
You think this is awesome?
This is killing us, Elliot.

143
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,717
- Gideon, I'm not...
- Angela!

144
00:08:25,718 --> 00:08:28,215
Let's just see how this meeting goes today.

145
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,818
Their networks are getting
attacked every week.

146
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:33,233
Who knows if they'll
still even be a client.

147
00:08:34,448 --> 00:08:36,532
- They're coming in?
- Hey, what did we say

148
00:08:36,533 --> 00:08:39,763
about the dress code?

149
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,232
All right, now, look over those logs.

150
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,810
And be ready this afternoon in
case they have any questions.

151
00:08:44,811 --> 00:08:48,085
- Okay?
- Okay.

152
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,863
- Start smoking again?
- Did you not get my texts last night?

153
00:08:53,864 --> 00:08:56,223
I sent you exactly 13 of them.

154
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,348
Yeah, I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

155
00:09:01,329 --> 00:09:04,087
You promised me that you
were gonna try this time.

156
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:19,994
Stop thinking about something else

157
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:22,001
when I'm talking to you.

158
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:24,254
I hate when you do that.

159
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:27,464
Sorry. I was thinking about work.

160
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:29,799
Maybe that's why Gideon loves you so much.

161
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,799
He thanks me all the
time for bringing you in.

162
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,011
But for some reason, I think
you secretly hate it here.

163
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,799
She was right. I liked most of the people,

164
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,690
but our business, a cyber security firm

165
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,434
that protects corporations... I
can't think of anything I hate more.

166
00:09:43,435 --> 00:09:47,283
No, I love it here.

167
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:55,263
I'm sorry. I'm just in a bad mood.

168
00:09:56,599 --> 00:09:59,055
I'm late on my last two
student loan payments,

169
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,799
and I can't get Gideon to give me a raise.

170
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,499
- Hey...
- Hi.

171
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,661
Yo, buddy. Missed you last night.

172
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,807
- Where were you?
- Gotta go. Big meeting today.

173
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:15,878
- Did you find out what happened?
- Yeah.

174
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,536
He said he was working.

175
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:18,836
Oh, come on. You gotta talk to him.

176
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,122
We're gonna be late for the staff meeting.

177
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:23,074
He can't stand me. And you know why.

178
00:10:23,075 --> 00:10:27,389
Angela, I can't have that
kind of negativity in my life.

179
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,799
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

180
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,799
What are you thinking about?

181
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,799
Nothing.

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,799
You want to know what I'm thinking about?

183
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,799
First time you came to me.

184
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,366
I didn't exactly come to Krista.

185
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,799
I was forced here. But I do like her.

186
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,348
Hacking her was simple.
Her password: Dylan 2791.

187
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:05,639
Favorite artist and the year in
which she was born, backwards.

188
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,610
Though she's a psychologist,

189
00:11:07,611 --> 00:11:09,345
she's really bad at reading people.

190
00:11:09,346 --> 00:11:11,399
But I'm good at reading people.

191
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,933
My secret: I look for the worst in them.

192
00:11:15,699 --> 00:11:17,699
I know she went through
a divorce four years ago.

193
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,699
I know she was devastated by it

194
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,699
and has been dating losers
on eHarmony ever since.

195
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:27,999
Her most recent foray... Michael Hansen.

196
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,113
I searched for him online,
but nothing came up.

197
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:33,403
No LinkedIn, no Facebook, nothing.

198
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:35,202
Something about him bugs me,

199
00:11:35,203 --> 00:11:36,845
scratching that part of my mind again.

200
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,364
But I'll hack him soon enough. I always do.

201
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,400
I know you're not yelling like before,

202
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:42,699
which is good.

203
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,899
But I can tell you're
still holding on to it.

204
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,470
And we need to work on
your anger issues, Elliot.

205
00:11:48,471 --> 00:11:51,199
You're angry at everyone, at society...

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,161
Fuck society.

207
00:11:52,562 --> 00:11:54,299
I know you have a lot to be angry about,

208
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,058
but keeping it to yourself and
staying quiet like you're doing...

209
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:59,807
it's not going to help you.

210
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:03,882
There's pain underneath. That's
where our work needs to go.

211
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,855
What is it about society
that disappoints you so much?

212
00:12:18,255 --> 00:12:20,608
Oh, I don't know.

213
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,481
Is it that we collectively
thought Steve Jobs

214
00:12:23,482 --> 00:12:25,432
was a great man, even when we knew

215
00:12:25,433 --> 00:12:29,850
he made billions off the backs of children?

216
00:12:29,851 --> 00:12:34,027
Or maybe it's that it feels like
all our heroes are counterfeit.

217
00:12:34,272 --> 00:12:37,387
The world itself's just one big hoax.

218
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:41,443
Spamming with our running
commentary of bullshit

219
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:46,421
masquerading as insight, our
social media faking as intimacy.

220
00:12:48,108 --> 00:12:51,110
Or is it that we voted for this?

221
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,345
Not with our rigged
elections, but with our things,

222
00:12:53,346 --> 00:12:55,517
our property, our money.

223
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:58,234
I'm not saying anything new.
We all know why we do this,

224
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,791
not because Hunger Games
books makes us happy

225
00:13:01,176 --> 00:13:03,342
but because we wanna be sedated.

226
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:05,352
Because it's painful not to pretend,

227
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:08,666
because we're cowards.

228
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:11,642
Fuck society.

229
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:14,733
Elliot. You're not saying anything.

230
00:13:16,059 --> 00:13:19,103
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

231
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,710
Don't be frustrated.

232
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:30,590
- Why shouldn't I be?
- You're different than most.

233
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,509
You at least try.

234
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,729
You at least understand.

235
00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:43,614
- Understand what?
- What it's like to feel alone.

236
00:13:45,596 --> 00:13:47,621
You understand the pain.

237
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:51,159
You want to protect people from it.

238
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,097
You want to protect me from it.

239
00:13:55,623 --> 00:13:58,247
I respect that about you.

240
00:14:02,932 --> 00:14:03,924
Why do you think I know

241
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:07,918
- what it's like to feel alone?
- Shit! From her emails!

242
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,094
- Elliot?
- I don't know.

243
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,454
Let's talk about last night.

244
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:20,389
Did you go to Angela's birthday party?

245
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,651
Yeah. It was nice.

246
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:30,738
- Did you try to talk to anyone?
- Sure.

247
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,298
I got a girl's number.

248
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:35,362
You did?

249
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,426
She's cute.

250
00:14:37,427 --> 00:14:40,522
She likes The Hunger Games.

251
00:14:43,118 --> 00:14:46,896
You're hiding again, Elliot.

252
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:51,610
When you hide, your delusions come back.

253
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:54,486
It's a slippery slope.

254
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:59,585
Let's talk about the men
in black you've been seeing.

255
00:14:59,586 --> 00:15:04,784
- Are they still there?
- No,

256
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,464
I... told you they're gone.

257
00:15:07,465 --> 00:15:10,799
The meds you gave me are working.

258
00:15:16,285 --> 00:15:17,303
Yo, man.

259
00:15:17,304 --> 00:15:19,303
Do you wanna, uh...

260
00:15:19,304 --> 00:15:22,301
- you wanna do lunch today?
- Uh, yeah...

261
00:15:22,302 --> 00:15:24,345
- I got other plans.
- Other plans. Right.

262
00:15:24,346 --> 00:15:28,499
That's... what you said the
last three times I asked you.

263
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,494
Look, bud, you... and Angela

264
00:15:31,495 --> 00:15:33,491
have been close for a long time,

265
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:36,486
and that's even more
reason why I want us to be

266
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:38,483
on good terms.

267
00:15:38,484 --> 00:15:42,141
I... I just... I feel like things
have been awkward between us.

268
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:44,666
- Don't you?
- I'm okay

269
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:47,482
with it being awkward between us.

270
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:51,764
Um, yeah. I... I'm...
I'm not okay with that.

271
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:56,620
Um... look, man, I love
Angela, and I want us to...

272
00:15:56,621 --> 00:15:59,582
to get along for her sake.
I mean, that's what I'm...

273
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,545
that's what I'm here for. I just, I...

274
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:06,049
- I don't normally do stuff...
- Am I crazy not to like this guy?

275
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,086
Among some of his Facebook likes

276
00:16:08,087 --> 00:16:10,067
are George W. Bush's Decision Points,

277
00:16:10,068 --> 00:16:12,047
Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen,

278
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:15,018
and the music of Josh Groban.

279
00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:17,677
Must I really justify myself any further?

280
00:16:17,678 --> 00:16:19,498
I'm working on that shit, you know?

281
00:16:20,461 --> 00:16:24,189
His was the easiest to hack.
Password was 123456Seven.

282
00:16:25,789 --> 00:16:29,088
I witnessed his first "I love
you" with Angela over Gchat,

283
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,550
then I witnessed the first of
many infidelities with Stella B.

284
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:36,485
I've never done anything
like this before...

285
00:16:36,486 --> 00:16:37,803
I've thought about telling Angela,

286
00:16:37,804 --> 00:16:40,380
but she has shitty taste in
men, and I'm not quite ready

287
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:42,304
to see what comes after this just yet.

288
00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:43,436
You like music. I like music.

289
00:16:43,437 --> 00:16:45,465
Maroon 5.

290
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,144
Plus I can manage Ollie
easier than the others.

291
00:16:48,145 --> 00:16:49,538
for now, anyway.

292
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:50,523
And that's all I mean.

293
00:16:50,524 --> 00:16:52,552
I just want you to know that.

294
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:54,982
I like you, bro, and...

295
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,012
I want you to like me too.

296
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:00,056
I understand.

297
00:17:00,057 --> 00:17:01,795
I'll try harder.

298
00:17:01,796 --> 00:17:03,749
That's cool, man.

299
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,906
Hey, whenever you're
ready, I'd love to just...

300
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,915
chill.

301
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,382
Oh... forgot about your...

302
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:16,365
no touching thing.

303
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:22,621
Truth is, I shouldn't hate
Ollie; he's not that bad a guy.

304
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,666
He's too dumb to be bad.

305
00:17:25,644 --> 00:17:29,232
In fact, when I think about
the really bad people...

306
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:35,093
E Corp, the largest
conglomerate in the world...

307
00:17:35,094 --> 00:17:38,857
they're so big, they're
literally everywhere.

308
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:42,079
A perfect monster of modern society.

309
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,901
The E might as well stand for Evil.

310
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,506
- And all of life's necessities...
- In fact, after a thorough,

311
00:17:48,507 --> 00:17:51,035
intensive self-reprogramming,
that's all my mind hears,

312
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,142
sees, or reads when
they pop up in my world.

313
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,546
That was have to offer.

314
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:57,499
Together, we can change
the world, with E...

315
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,499
Evil Corp.

316
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,031
Krista would have a shit
fit if she knew I did that.

317
00:18:02,032 --> 00:18:05,771
But that's what they are...
a conglomerate of evil.

318
00:18:06,099 --> 00:18:09,070
- And now I have to help them.
- There are six on-site engineers

319
00:18:09,071 --> 00:18:10,310
on your account.

320
00:18:10,311 --> 00:18:13,646
- Plus a few off-site...
- There he is, Terry Colby, the CTO.

321
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,989
Even though he's the head technology guy

322
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:19,386
at one of the biggest companies
in the world, he owns a Blackberry.

323
00:18:20,795 --> 00:18:22,296
So this is it right here.

324
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:25,017
But also looks like he doesn't
see a terminal very often

325
00:18:25,018 --> 00:18:27,351
He's not a techie. He's a moron.

326
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:31,924
An arrogant moron. The worst kind.

327
00:18:37,502 --> 00:18:40,137
Oh, hi. Tyrell Wellick.

328
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:42,534
I'm Senior Vice President, Technology.

329
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:48,427
- Elliot. Just a tech.
- Don't be so humble.

330
00:18:48,428 --> 00:18:51,314
You know, I started out
exactly where you are,

331
00:18:51,315 --> 00:18:54,359
and... to be honest, you
know, my heart is still there.

332
00:18:55,077 --> 00:18:57,884
So I see you're running Gnome.

333
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,228
You know, I'm actually on KDE myself.

334
00:19:01,229 --> 00:19:04,335
I know this desktop environment
is supposed to be better but...

335
00:19:04,932 --> 00:19:06,324
you know what they say.

336
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:10,437
- Old habits... they die hard.
- An executive running Linux with...

337
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:12,109
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

338
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,198
I'm an executive. I mean...

339
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:16,193
why am I even running Linux?

340
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:19,199
Again... old habits.

341
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:24,459
It's gonna be fun working with you.

342
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:27,999
I should join the rest of the group.

343
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,999
Bonsoir, Elliot.

344
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:39,699
Sometimes I dream of saving the world.

345
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,222
Saving everyone from the invisible hand,

346
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:48,999
one that brands us with an employee badge.

347
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:55,035
The one that forces us to work for them...

348
00:19:56,272 --> 00:19:59,921
The one that controls us every
day without us knowing it.

349
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,999
But I can't stop it.

350
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,999
I'm not that special.

351
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:09,999
I'm just anonymous.

352
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,999
I'm just alone.

353
00:20:15,566 --> 00:20:17,788
If it weren't for Qwerty,

354
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:19,999
I'd be completely empty.

355
00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:29,252
I hate when I can't hold in my loneliness.

356
00:20:31,137 --> 00:20:32,734
This crying has been happening too often,

357
00:20:32,735 --> 00:20:34,827
every other week now.

358
00:20:38,699 --> 00:20:41,699
What do normal people do
when they get this sad?

359
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,999
They reach out to friends
or family, I think.

360
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,999
That's not an option.

361
00:20:54,999 --> 00:20:57,999
I do morphine.

362
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,844
The key to doing morphine
without turning into a junkie

363
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:03,725
is to limit yourself
to 30 milligrams a day.

364
00:21:03,726 --> 00:21:04,973
Anything more

365
00:21:04,974 --> 00:21:07,899
just builds up your tolerance.

366
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,999
I check every pill I get for purity.

367
00:21:11,689 --> 00:21:13,999
I have 8 milligram Suboxone for maintenance

368
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,999
in case I go through withdrawals.

369
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,999
Shit! I'm out again.

370
00:21:22,374 --> 00:21:26,293
- How much?
- On the house.

371
00:21:26,594 --> 00:21:29,699
No, Shayla. Not doing that.

372
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,299
Okay? This is just a regular drug deal

373
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,299
- like it always is.
- Fine.

374
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,034
So what are you you to tonight?

375
00:21:36,035 --> 00:21:37,999
'Cause I tried to post
something on your Facebook

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,659
and couldn't find you.

377
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,527
I'm not on Facebook.

378
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:45,139
- What? Why not?
- 'Cause I hate Facebook.

379
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,999
That's crazy.

380
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:54,679
Well... you want to do these together then?

381
00:21:55,102 --> 00:21:57,700
Pure Molly...

382
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:13,330
Don't ever make decisions
when you're on morphine.

383
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:27,399
Instagram check-in for
Krista at Pierre Loti.

384
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,013
Okay, Michael Hansen.

385
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,457
Time to find out who you really are.

386
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,399
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

387
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,299
Taxi!

388
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:35,299
Uh, hi... I just left my
keys in one of your cabs.

389
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,299
56Y2.

390
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:39,599
Sure.

391
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:44,699
What about you two? Huh?

392
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,299
You guys got any spare change?

393
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:49,698
Help me out?

394
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:51,899
New York's expensive, guys. Come on.

395
00:23:53,235 --> 00:23:55,999
306 Hawthorne. Thank you. Thank you.

396
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,500
Come on, asshole. Piss already.

397
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,080
Come on!

398
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:23,699
Come on! Will you... will you go?

399
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,925
- Come on, go, go!
- Hey!

400
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:26,513
Go, will ya?

401
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:28,000
Hey.

402
00:24:31,718 --> 00:24:32,999
May I borrow your phone?

403
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,999
Mine's dead. I need to call my mom.

404
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,399
Thank you.

405
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,499
No answer. Thanks anyway.

406
00:25:23,671 --> 00:25:27,873
- Angela, is everything okay?
- I need you to come to AllSafe.

407
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,173
You're there? It's 3:00 in the morning.

408
00:25:30,174 --> 00:25:33,259
They attacked Evil Corp servers
again, but it's bad this time.

409
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,100
It's a DDoS attack.

410
00:25:35,099 --> 00:25:37,877
- Did you call Lloyd? He's on call.
- Yeah, he's here.

411
00:25:38,596 --> 00:25:42,684
- Is he talking to their tech department?
- He's online with them, but so far nothing.

412
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,131
I don't think that Lloyd can handle this.

413
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,902
Look, Gideon just put me on this account.

414
00:25:49,903 --> 00:25:51,572
I can't screw up in my first week.

415
00:25:51,573 --> 00:25:54,199
I need you. Please.

416
00:25:55,699 --> 00:25:57,441
I'll be right there.

417
00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,207
- Finally!
- Calm down... it's only been an hour.

418
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:16,026
Yeah, well, an hour in Evil Corp time is
like $13 million in revenue, approximately.

419
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:17,661
Actually, I calculated that.

420
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,673
That's exactly how much they lost.

421
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:21,926
Don't worry. I got you.

422
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:24,299
Lloyd, what's up?

423
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,299
Lloyd!

424
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,386
Elliot. This is bad.

425
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:30,968
Worst DDoS attack I've ever seen.

426
00:26:30,969 --> 00:26:33,541
- Did you reconfigure the DNS?
- Yes!

427
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:35,783
- Stop the services.
- I already stopped the services,

428
00:26:35,784 --> 00:26:38,160
tries to reboot the servers
but they're not coming back up.

429
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,415
Dude, someone is straight up fingerblasting
their entire network right now.

430
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:01,082
They just started reporting on the outage.

431
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,575
Shit. This is worse than I
thought. They're in the network?

432
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:13,518
What's the status update?

433
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:16,023
He's here. I thought we
set up security protocols

434
00:27:16,024 --> 00:27:19,419
so that this doesn't happen.

435
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:21,788
- Where's the attack coming from?
- Everywhere, obviously.

436
00:27:21,789 --> 00:27:25,210
- The USA, Finland, Thailand, Kuwait...
- Start restarting the services, load sharing,

437
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,348
redirect the traffic.
Call Prolexic for help.

438
00:27:27,968 --> 00:27:31,634
- Wait. What?
- I don't think this is just a DDoS attack.

439
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:36,046
I think they got a rootkit
sitting inside the servers.

440
00:27:36,372 --> 00:27:38,927
- What's a rootkit?
- It's like a crazy serial

441
00:27:38,928 --> 00:27:40,399
rapist with a very big dick.

442
00:27:40,803 --> 00:27:44,387
- Jesus, Lloyd.
- Sorry. It's malicious code that completely

443
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:46,961
takes over their system.
It can delete system files

444
00:27:46,962 --> 00:27:49,494
and stop programs. Viruses, worms...

445
00:27:49,495 --> 00:27:51,202
- How do we stop it?
- That's the thing.

446
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,345
It's fundamentally
invisible... you can't stop it.

447
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:54,719
All of their servers are timing out.

448
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,034
None of them are coming back up.

449
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,143
That's because every
time we restart the server

450
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,105
the virus replicates itself during boot up

451
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:01,242
and crashes the host.

452
00:28:01,243 --> 00:28:02,410
_

453
00:28:02,631 --> 00:28:04,282
How are we supposed to bring up the network

454
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:08,084
- if we can't restart the servers?
- We can't.

455
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,299
Which is what they wanted.

456
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:14,791
By defending ourselves, we ended
up spreading the virus everywhere.

457
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:16,998
Only thing we can do

458
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:19,299
is we've gotta take the
whole system offline,

459
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,328
wipe the infected servers
clean, then bring them back up.

460
00:28:24,884 --> 00:28:26,299
You're coming with me.

461
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,274
- Yeah.
- Lloyd.

462
00:28:28,275 --> 00:28:30,502
Tell everybody to start
taking everything offline.

463
00:28:30,503 --> 00:28:33,220
- On it.
- Uh, the server farm in Dulles.

464
00:28:33,221 --> 00:28:34,824
We're gonna need the jet.

465
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:51,145
They're booting the network back up.

466
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,967
Now, you're downloading
the logs, right because...

467
00:28:52,968 --> 00:28:54,909
- Stop. Tell him to stop.
- What?

468
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,199
Don't start the boot
sequence. You guys missed one.

469
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,964
There's an infected server up and running.

470
00:29:00,899 --> 00:29:02,899
What's the ETA before it hits this server?

471
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:10,599
The backup server up and running?

472
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,373
It's ready, but it's not
configured for auto switch.

473
00:29:19,104 --> 00:29:21,805
We need to redirect the
traffic, need to switch DNS.

474
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,861
You got this, you got this, you got this.

475
00:29:29,515 --> 00:29:32,452
- This is impossible.
- You got this, you got this, you got this.

476
00:29:33,074 --> 00:29:35,423
It's almost at the back server!

477
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,400
We still up?

478
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:55,894
We're okay.

479
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:59,137
Yeah.

480
00:30:07,116 --> 00:30:08,725
Hank.

481
00:30:08,726 --> 00:30:10,527
I'm gonna take a look at
the infected server, okay?

482
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:14,806
- Give me a minute.
- Yeah. Uh... I'll meet you at the elevators.

483
00:30:21,072 --> 00:30:22,835
They must have left a mark or something.

484
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:24,752
Every hacker loves attention.

485
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:27,479
They don't just do DDoS
attacks for no reason.

486
00:30:33,821 --> 00:30:36,626
This is it. Fsociety.

487
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:39,099
Is that supposed to be a joke?

488
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,471
This was way too easy. They
didn't hide it well at all.

489
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:46,083
_

490
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:49,189
_

491
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:52,485
This note is for me.

492
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:55,885
They're telling me to leave it here.

493
00:30:55,886 --> 00:30:59,152
But why? Doesn't matter.

494
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:01,376
Time to shut them down.

495
00:31:04,991 --> 00:31:06,568
Why can't I delete it?

496
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,081
I don't want to delete
it. I want it to stay.

497
00:31:09,082 --> 00:31:11,299
What's wrong with me?

498
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,735
I'll reconfigure the
access to the root directory

499
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:23,957
so only I can use it. And no one will know.

500
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:29,702
For you, sir.

501
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:40,302
- Did you know that I'm gay?
- Uh...

502
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:46,331
- No.
- Hmm.

503
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:53,199
Consider this me coming
out to you then, okay?

504
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,799
It's hard because I don't
like to talk about my sex life.

505
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,799
But my partner, he gets very paranoid.

506
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,799
He thinks I'm ashamed of...

507
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,799
He wants me to be more public about it, so,

508
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,799
Anyway, I'm gay.

509
00:32:12,499 --> 00:32:14,499
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

510
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,007
Hey, man, don't worry about it.

511
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,099
Hackers have a short attention span.

512
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,829
They'll get bored, harass someone else.

513
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,899
Evil Corp is thinking about leaving us.

514
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,036
And I don't know if I can blame them.

515
00:32:38,899 --> 00:32:41,733
They could have called
their other security teams.

516
00:32:41,734 --> 00:32:43,684
- Mm.
- They called you.

517
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:46,800
Well, somebody over there likes us,

518
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,736
but Terry Colby, he's getting the pressure.

519
00:32:49,737 --> 00:32:53,722
and he calls the shots.

520
00:32:53,723 --> 00:32:56,899
Evil Corp is 80% of our business.

521
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,899
If we lose them, it's gonna be it for us.

522
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,805
It's gonna be it...

523
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,899
For me.

524
00:33:13,352 --> 00:33:15,502
I feel like I can talk to you.

525
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:19,845
I mean, more than the others, anyway.

526
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:25,298
I'm sure, in a weird way,
you'll be happy if we went under.

527
00:33:25,999 --> 00:33:28,480
Oh, come on. Come on.

528
00:33:29,699 --> 00:33:32,573
I know you hate wearing
those stupid shirts.

529
00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:43,899
Gideon?

530
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,099
I promise I'll find them.

531
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,874
Evil Corp service should
be back up soon enough.

532
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:07,855
I'll take a look at the dat
file. I'll ask my IRC contacts

533
00:34:07,856 --> 00:34:09,649
about fsociety when I get home.

534
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,706
I've never seen their
name on the boards though.

535
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:13,899
They've gotta be new, but they're good.

536
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:22,899
Rough night?

537
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:30,519
I'm getting off here.

538
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,699
I think you should come with me.

539
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:36,899
But only if you didn't delete it.

540
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,472
You deleted it, we got
nothing to talk about.

541
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:43,761
Are you talking to me?

542
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:50,151
Stand clear of the closing doors, please.

543
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:07,529
- Who are you?
- We gotta wait for the Q.

544
00:35:14,899 --> 00:35:18,919
- Then what?
- Then we're going to Brooklyn.

545
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,735
Out by Coney Island.

546
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,575
Why?

547
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:28,425
What's there?

548
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:32,899
Obviously you're gonna
ask a lot of questions.

549
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,873
It's weird what you're
doing right now, I get it.

550
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:40,799
I... I can't tell you
anything until we get there.

551
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:51,013
Can't smoke in here.

552
00:35:55,699 --> 00:35:57,785
You've been following me.

553
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:00,553
Why?

554
00:36:02,699 --> 00:36:05,699
What do you want from me?

555
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:12,699
My dad was a petty thief.

556
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,699
Never could hold down a job.

557
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,953
So, he just robbed,
convenience stores, shops,

558
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:20,023
small-time stuff.

559
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:23,549
One time, he sat me down, he
told me something I never forgot.

560
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:28,411
He said, "Everyone steals.
That's how it works.

561
00:36:28,412 --> 00:36:32,545
You think people out there are
getting exactly what they deserve? No.

562
00:36:32,546 --> 00:36:34,699
They're getting paid over or under,

563
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:38,088
but someone in the chain
always gets bamboozled.

564
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:44,699
I steal, son, but I don't get caught.

565
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,699
That's my contract with society.

566
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,699
Now if you can catch me
stealing, I'll go to jail.

567
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:54,396
But if you can't, then
I've earned the money."

568
00:36:58,108 --> 00:37:00,418
I respected that, man.

569
00:37:02,699 --> 00:37:06,935
I thought that shit was
cool as a little kid.

570
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,699
A few years after that,

571
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,699
they finally caught him.

572
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,764
Sent him to jail.

573
00:37:17,765 --> 00:37:21,975
Dies five years later.
My respect goes with him.

574
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:28,556
I thought he was free doing
what he did, but he wasn't.

575
00:37:30,153 --> 00:37:32,365
He was in prison.

576
00:37:33,699 --> 00:37:36,551
Just like you are now, Elliot.

577
00:37:38,699 --> 00:37:41,699
But I'm gonna break you out.

578
00:38:37,881 --> 00:38:43,532
- Why would you guys actually meet IRL?
- You remember that hacker group O-Megz?

579
00:38:43,533 --> 00:38:45,374
They got outed by their
own leader to the FBI,

580
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,067
and six hackers went to prison for it?

581
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:48,530
You know how they got 'em?

582
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:50,095
They went on the dude's computer,

583
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:55,713
tracked 'em all down through emails,
VPN sessions, chat messages, texts.

584
00:38:55,714 --> 00:38:57,699
One guy, and the whole thing comes down.

585
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,819
- It's what's called...
- A central point of failure.

586
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,185
Right. Because they
refused to meet in person,

587
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:07,141
they compromised each other every time
they sent so much as a smiley face.

588
00:39:07,142 --> 00:39:11,764
The rule here is, it's
done here, and only here.

589
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:17,102
It ends when you walk out that
door, and begins when you walk in.

590
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:21,141
Our encryption is the real world.

591
00:39:21,699 --> 00:39:24,762
- How do you talk to each other then?
- We don't.

592
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:27,683
We come and go, work on
the project when we can.

593
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,699
- How do you trust them?
- I give them an exercise.

594
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,691
If they pass, they join us.

595
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:38,584
- If they fail...
- The DDoS attack last night,

596
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:42,469
you were testing me.

597
00:39:49,284 --> 00:39:51,418
You said there was a project.

598
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:54,966
- What's the project?
- That'll come later.

599
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:57,328
I just wanted you to see the place.

600
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,999
There's not much you can do without a CPU.

601
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:12,356
I'm crazy.

602
00:40:12,357 --> 00:40:14,999
I have to be crazy because
that didn't just happen, right?

603
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,013
This is a delusion. Is this a
delusion? Shit, I'm a schizo.

604
00:40:20,999 --> 00:40:24,073
Have I really lost it this time?
No, no. Last night happened.

605
00:40:24,074 --> 00:40:26,438
It was real. Angela called
me. I was at AllSafe.

606
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,999
Evil Corp's servers were compromised.

607
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,999
Those are facts, not delusions.

608
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,608
I know. I know, I know I
realize I'm saying all of this

609
00:40:32,609 --> 00:40:36,057
to an imaginary person, but I created you.

610
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:38,493
I didn't create this.

611
00:40:38,999 --> 00:40:41,181
Oh, thank God you're here.

612
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:43,827
I was just about to go
wait in the Starbucks.

613
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,182
You live in a bad neighborhood.

614
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:48,836
- Do you know that?
- I do know that.

615
00:40:49,399 --> 00:40:54,149
Do you want to get high and
watch your favorite movie?

616
00:40:54,999 --> 00:40:58,611
Oh, you saved our asses last night. I
thought Gideon was definitely gonna fire me.

617
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,129
Where have you been?

618
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:06,972
- I thought you'd be sleeping.
- I... yeah, I fell asleep on the train.

619
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,564
That sounds like such a lie,

620
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:15,770
but, whatever. I don't want
to get into that right now.

621
00:41:16,071 --> 00:41:18,154
So you want to do this?

622
00:41:23,499 --> 00:41:26,839
I miss Qwerty. I hope she still loves me.

623
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:36,799
Shit.

624
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,972
She wasn't supposed to be here, okay?

625
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:42,031
- Give me a minute and I'll get rid of her.
- That's okay.

626
00:41:42,032 --> 00:41:45,951
Um... This is great.

627
00:41:46,701 --> 00:41:48,997
- Elliot, I'm happy for you.
- No, it's not like that.

628
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:53,540
Well, maybe it should be, you
know? It's good that you're...

629
00:41:55,699 --> 00:41:57,564
dating.

630
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,133
Well, I'll see you on Monday.

631
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:04,599
We can do movie night next time.

632
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,317
- I promise, okay?
- Yeah.

633
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,006
Have fun.

634
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,375
Mm, Elliot?

635
00:42:33,991 --> 00:42:38,772
Oh, shit. Is it Wednesday?

636
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:41,840
- Shayla.
- I have to move my car.

637
00:42:41,841 --> 00:42:45,757
Shayla, leave.

638
00:42:48,116 --> 00:42:49,599
Now.

639
00:42:52,952 --> 00:42:54,770
No mention of Mr. Robot anywhere.

640
00:42:54,771 --> 00:42:56,599
No mention of fsociety.

641
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,116
Not on any of the hacker boards.

642
00:42:58,117 --> 00:43:02,011
Not on IRC, forums, blogs,
no one's heard of them.

643
00:43:05,914 --> 00:43:09,979
Property was owned by Fun Society
Amusement, LLC for 13 years.

644
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:12,839
Owner was shot a killed
a year and a half ago.

645
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,315
No owner since.

646
00:43:14,616 --> 00:43:17,999
And the ownership history before
that is sparse to nonexistent.

647
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,533
This guy is good. Very good.

648
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:31,135
Doesn't matter. Their arcade
network's IP is in the DAT file.

649
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,409
That'll be enough to turn them in.

650
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:53,699
What's your ask, Mr. Robot?

651
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,692
Hey, man,

652
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,241
- where's your boss?
- Okay, cut the bullshit.

653
00:44:12,529 --> 00:44:15,628
When are you going to give us
access to the root directory?

654
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:19,007
What? Dude, come on.

655
00:44:19,008 --> 00:44:20,599
I wrote that rootkit.

656
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,599
I still have to put
Colby's IP in the DAT file.

657
00:44:29,799 --> 00:44:31,683
Dickhead.

658
00:44:33,499 --> 00:44:35,951
Elliot! Good news.

659
00:44:35,952 --> 00:44:38,008
I scored the last bag of
Twinkies from Gristedes.

660
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,993
- You want one?
- She just called me a dickhead.

661
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:45,366
Yeah, that's Darlene.

662
00:44:45,367 --> 00:44:49,379
Hey, you like Ferris wheels?

663
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:54,662
Ah, it's beautiful.

664
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:57,145
Gets better the higher up you go, you know?

665
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,599
Oh, I love it up here.

666
00:45:02,175 --> 00:45:07,283
- You like it?
- I'm here to tell you I'm turning you in.

667
00:45:07,931 --> 00:45:11,454
- I'm giving them all the information.
- Let me tell you why you're really here.

668
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,108
You're here because you sense
something wrong with the world.

669
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:18,668
Something you can't explain.

670
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:20,760
But...

671
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:23,519
you know it controls you
and everyone you care about.

672
00:45:24,479 --> 00:45:26,506
What are you talking about?

673
00:45:29,453 --> 00:45:31,193
Money.

674
00:45:31,499 --> 00:45:35,372
Money hasn't been real since
we got off the gold standard.

675
00:45:35,373 --> 00:45:37,044
It's become virtual.

676
00:45:37,045 --> 00:45:40,723
Software. The operating
system of our world.

677
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:46,952
And, Elliot, we are on the verge
of taking down this virtual reality.

678
00:45:49,348 --> 00:45:50,885
Think about it.

679
00:45:51,434 --> 00:45:55,634
What if you could take
down one conglomerate?

680
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,631
A conglomerate so deeply entrenched

681
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:04,378
in the world's economy, that
too big to fail to describing it.

682
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:07,445
You want to create
another financial meltdown

683
00:46:07,446 --> 00:46:11,017
like the one we just had, but way worse.

684
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,712
Yeah, why would I want that?

685
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,358
Everyone would lose their money.

686
00:46:14,359 --> 00:46:16,440
What if I told you that this conglomerate

687
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:20,110
just so happens to own 70% of the
global consumer credit industry?

688
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,686
Huh? If we hit their
data center just right,

689
00:46:22,687 --> 00:46:25,019
we could systematically
format all the servers,

690
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,129
- including backup.
- That would erase all...

691
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,350
All the debt we owe them.

692
00:46:29,351 --> 00:46:32,528
Every record of every credit
card, loan, and mortgage

693
00:46:32,529 --> 00:46:33,991
would be wiped clean.

694
00:46:35,062 --> 00:46:36,293
It would be impossible to reinforce

695
00:46:36,295 --> 00:46:37,758
outdated paper records.

696
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,788
It would all be gone.

697
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,387
The single biggest incident

698
00:46:43,389 --> 00:46:47,450
of wealth redistribution in history.

699
00:46:53,047 --> 00:46:57,308
Evil Corp. The conglomerate.

700
00:46:57,310 --> 00:46:59,206
That's why you picked me.

701
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:00,772
Because I work at AllSafe.

702
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:03,936
Tomorrow, AllSafe is going to get a visit

703
00:47:03,938 --> 00:47:07,999
from the FBI and the U.S. Cyber Command.

704
00:47:08,001 --> 00:47:12,429
You are going to modify the DAT file

705
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:17,258
and put Colby's terminal
IP address in there.

706
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:19,889
Terry Colby?

707
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:24,019
You're gonna frame him? No
one's gonna believe that.

708
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:26,316
I met him, he's a moron.

709
00:47:26,318 --> 00:47:28,182
So are the FBI.

710
00:47:28,184 --> 00:47:29,914
Even if they don't believe he did it,

711
00:47:29,916 --> 00:47:33,311
they'll believe he gave
someone access to it.

712
00:47:33,313 --> 00:47:34,877
Yeah, he'll just go to jail.

713
00:47:34,879 --> 00:47:37,775
- What good will that do?
- You don't take down a conglomerate

714
00:47:37,776 --> 00:47:39,706
by shooting them in the heart.

715
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:41,271
That's the thing about conglomerates,

716
00:47:41,273 --> 00:47:43,269
they don't have hearts.

717
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:46,034
You take them down limb by limb.

718
00:47:46,036 --> 00:47:47,433
And as they unravel,

719
00:47:47,435 --> 00:47:50,697
their illusion of control unravels.

720
00:47:56,693 --> 00:48:01,605
- Who are you?
- That'll come later.

721
00:48:01,656 --> 00:48:06,283
Right now, you have a lot to think about.

722
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:08,914
You have to change the DAT file

723
00:48:08,916 --> 00:48:11,978
and put Colby's IP in there.

724
00:48:14,645 --> 00:48:17,174
You do that,

725
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:19,339
you have set in motion
the largest revolution

726
00:48:19,341 --> 00:48:22,703
the world will ever see.

727
00:50:55,183 --> 00:51:00,737
- So, what do we got?
- So, if you'll take a look

728
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,235
at the first page of your agenda...

729
00:51:02,237 --> 00:51:05,699
You're the one who stopped the hack.

730
00:51:05,701 --> 00:51:08,796
You know, the gals in analysis
said this was a tough one.

731
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:10,229
All things being equal,

732
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:12,793
it should have shut us down for days, so...

733
00:51:12,795 --> 00:51:15,224
you did good.

734
00:51:15,226 --> 00:51:18,754
Okay.

735
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:22,152
We should start with our
account executive, Angela.

736
00:51:22,154 --> 00:51:23,950
Okay, we first noticed the breach

737
00:51:23,952 --> 00:51:27,947
at 2:07 A.M. Eastern
Standard on Friday night.

738
00:51:28,354 --> 00:51:32,363
- You mean, Saturday?
- Sorry, yes,

739
00:51:32,364 --> 00:51:34,378
technically, Saturday morning.

740
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:36,905
Yeah, okay, Angela,
that's what we're here for.

741
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:39,204
The technicals.

742
00:51:39,998 --> 00:51:41,325
Right.

743
00:51:42,001 --> 00:51:45,581
Yes. Anyway, he arrived at the office

744
00:51:45,582 --> 00:51:47,707
- at 2:35 and I instru...
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

745
00:51:48,708 --> 00:51:50,339
So that's almost a half hour
after the initial breach.

746
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,179
Why didn't anyone pipe
in from their laptops?

747
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:54,458
- It's not protocol...
- It wouldn't have been secure

748
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:57,855
if someone terminaled in on this.

749
00:51:57,857 --> 00:52:01,552
It was the smarter move
to have someone come in

750
00:52:01,554 --> 00:52:04,511
- so they can log in on a secure line.
- Exactly.

751
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:06,824
- Then Lloyd was able to...
- Just... just actually,

752
00:52:06,825 --> 00:52:08,738
just one second.

753
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,075
Yeah.

754
00:52:21,837 --> 00:52:23,933
You know, I, uh,

755
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,962
I always loved this view.

756
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:44,982
Now that that's taken care of,

757
00:52:44,984 --> 00:52:47,746
let's pick it up where we left off.

758
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:49,044
What happened to Angela?

759
00:52:49,046 --> 00:52:50,877
She knows more about what happened.

760
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:53,075
She's not going to work out
for us, not on this level.

761
00:52:53,077 --> 00:52:55,831
We need to stick to the
more tech savvy here.

762
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:01,335
Now, let's get to the heart of this thing

763
00:53:01,337 --> 00:53:03,467
because I can't sit here

764
00:53:03,469 --> 00:53:06,684
and look through a packet
for the next 20 minutes.

765
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:11,278
All right, just who did
this? Is it that hard?

766
00:53:12,061 --> 00:53:17,531
- Who did this?
- I found the configuration file

767
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:20,148
of the rootkit with a
pattern of IP addresses.

768
00:53:23,485 --> 00:53:28,013
Once you decrypt it, you'll
know where the hack came from.

769
00:53:40,143 --> 00:53:42,324
19 days.

770
00:53:45,905 --> 00:53:49,389
No news, no arrests, no revolution.

771
00:54:01,758 --> 00:54:05,820
No FBI, Colby, Evil Corp.

772
00:54:08,597 --> 00:54:11,905
_

773
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:22,738
No Mr. Robot.

774
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,804
No fsociety.

775
00:54:32,865 --> 00:54:35,928
I need to take my mind off things.

776
00:54:45,954 --> 00:54:48,570
- Hello.
- Hi, this is Sam

777
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:51,015
from Bank of E security fraud department.

778
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:52,913
Unfortunately I have to inform you

779
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,712
that your account's been compromised.

780
00:54:55,714 --> 00:54:58,991
- What? What happened?
- First before I can answer any questions,

781
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:00,587
I need to verify some information.

782
00:55:00,588 --> 00:55:05,022
- Are you still at 306 Hawthorne Avenue?
- Yes. Apartment 2C.

783
00:55:05,023 --> 00:55:07,192
- _
- Great. And your security question,

784
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:10,593
- favorite baseball team?
- Um, Yankees.

785
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:12,198
I don't remember this
being a security question.

786
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:15,782
- And lastly, your pet's name?
- Um, Flipper.

787
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:19,557
Who am I speaking to? Can
I get your name and number?

788
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:21,889
With those details plus a
dictionary brute-force attack,

789
00:55:21,891 --> 00:55:26,085
it'll take my program maybe two
minutes to crack his password.

790
00:55:33,714 --> 00:55:36,909
What I wouldn't give to be normal.

791
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:39,973
To live in that bubble,

792
00:55:39,975 --> 00:55:42,771
the reality of the naive.

793
00:55:46,237 --> 00:55:51,131
That's how I justify this.

794
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:54,229
To keep their optimism intact.

795
00:55:54,231 --> 00:55:57,692
To protect them.

796
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,439
_

797
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,628
How? He's too old to have
a complicated password.

798
00:56:03,629 --> 00:56:06,552
It had to have been a
combination of these things.

799
00:56:10,151 --> 00:56:11,614
I'm missing something,
I'm missing something,

800
00:56:11,616 --> 00:56:16,044
I'm missing something.

801
00:56:16,046 --> 00:56:17,709
Michael Hansen isn't his real name.

802
00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:29,033
Come on. Get over here.

803
00:56:32,132 --> 00:56:33,562
Lenny Shannon?

804
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:36,160
Michael Hansen?

805
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:39,624
Which one are you playing tonight?

806
00:56:39,626 --> 00:56:42,143
- You're going to stop seeing Krista.
- What the f...

807
00:56:43,144 --> 00:56:45,433
You're going to break up with her.
You're never going to see her again.

808
00:56:46,752 --> 00:56:49,449
You're the guy that used my phone.

809
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:51,880
You cheated on your current
wife with seven different women.

810
00:56:51,882 --> 00:56:53,882
I got digital proof of all of it.

811
00:56:53,883 --> 00:56:57,808
Ashley Madison, online
escorts, fake Facebook pages.

812
00:56:57,810 --> 00:56:59,973
I own it all.

813
00:56:59,975 --> 00:57:01,872
And if you don't stop seeing her,

814
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:06,001
your wife will know everything
along with the police.

815
00:57:06,003 --> 00:57:09,226
- The police?
- Yeah, one of the escorts was 15.

816
00:57:13,364 --> 00:57:14,636
That 15 part I made up,

817
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:16,692
but he did have a
proclivity for young escorts

818
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:18,024
that helped the lie.

819
00:57:18,026 --> 00:57:20,555
But I'm not gonna do any of that

820
00:57:20,557 --> 00:57:23,087
as long as you break up with Krista.

821
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:25,152
Tonight.

822
00:57:29,183 --> 00:57:32,046
Done.

823
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,211
You're also gonna tell her the truth.

824
00:57:34,213 --> 00:57:36,242
That you're married, cheat on your wife,

825
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,507
you hire hookers.

826
00:57:38,509 --> 00:57:41,637
That you never had any intention
of being serious with her.

827
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:43,070
Why?

828
00:57:43,072 --> 00:57:44,169
That would destroy her.

829
00:57:44,171 --> 00:57:46,500
She thinks that...

830
00:57:46,502 --> 00:57:48,466
We're in love.

831
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:50,996
Exactly. Krista needs to
avoid dickheads like you

832
00:57:50,998 --> 00:57:52,162
in the future.

833
00:57:52,164 --> 00:57:54,726
Her radar needs fixing.

834
00:57:54,728 --> 00:57:57,658
I'll know if you skip any detail.

835
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:01,821
So don't.

836
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:04,785
And one more thing...

837
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:07,715
I'm gonna need something from you.

838
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:13,578
Come on.

839
00:58:24,503 --> 00:58:28,798
Hmm. I like you, Flipper.

840
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,061
You're cool.

841
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,161
I never want to be right about my hacks,

842
00:58:34,163 --> 00:58:36,925
but people always find a way to disappoint.

843
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,916
Michael Hansen now gets
filed away among the others.

844
00:58:47,918 --> 00:58:50,281
Forever buried in my digital cemetery.

845
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:01,504
The look of disillusionment.

846
00:59:01,506 --> 00:59:04,068
He told her. She cried all night.

847
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:06,167
Now comes the sadness.

848
00:59:06,169 --> 00:59:08,595
I don't like seeing her sad.

849
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:15,359
- You okay?
- Sorry.

850
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:17,062
Sorry.

851
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:22,154
Go on.

852
00:59:22,156 --> 00:59:24,452
I think Angela blames me for what happened

853
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:26,916
at the Evil Corp meeting.

854
00:59:26,918 --> 00:59:29,248
What do I do? I need to talk to her.

855
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:32,545
I think you just answered
your own question.

856
00:59:32,547 --> 00:59:34,144
Talk to her.

857
00:59:34,146 --> 00:59:36,772
She won't respond to any
of my texts or emails.

858
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,873
Then go to her in person.

859
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:42,037
Tell her you need to talk.

860
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:45,401
Communication is key, Elliot.

861
00:59:45,403 --> 00:59:50,663
Real human interaction.

862
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:53,360
That's what's important for you right now.

863
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:07,049
Hey. Do you...

864
01:00:07,051 --> 01:00:09,314
- Do you think we can talk?
- What?

865
01:00:09,316 --> 01:00:10,912
You won't talk to me.

866
01:00:10,914 --> 01:00:12,311
You haven't talked to me since the meeting.

867
01:00:12,313 --> 01:00:13,809
I don't want to talk to you

868
01:00:13,811 --> 01:00:17,173
because I feel embarrassed

869
01:00:17,175 --> 01:00:19,271
every time I think about what happened.

870
01:00:19,273 --> 01:00:21,137
Okay?

871
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:24,167
It's fine. I'll get over it.

872
01:00:24,169 --> 01:00:26,102
- It's been three weeks.

           Hey, man.

    What, you think I forgot
           about you?

    Trust me, I need you now
        more than ever.

132
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,551
    Hacking Tyrell Wellick,
  you'd think it'd be tricky,

133
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:41,786
   but it wasn't--Evil Corp's

       since Shellshock.

     two-step verification.

     his wife's maiden name

137
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:50,862
and Sweden's independence date,
              6-6.

          to hack him?

             about the dat file?

177

       You could've come in here
  at any time before the meeting

     to say you found something,
                 but you didn't.

   I found that kind of curious.

your cover-ups of the murder of
  innocent, ordinary citizens,

207
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,908
        all for the sake
          of a profit.

208
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,079
   This is why we at fsociety
   have decided you must die.

     We do not compromise.

  is sliced off at the nerve.

        But we are also
       not without mercy.

        Our latest hack
     was our last warning.

00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:28,032
 Meet our demands, and we will
  consider not destroying you.

          immediately.

          of the world

219
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:39,544
      from your even more
 illegitimate prisons of debt.

  charities around the world.

       is non-negotiable.

     your economic slavery.

227
00:14:57,163 --> 00:15:01,132
      Meet these demands,

   we make it a double date?

     you had a girlfriend.

to say anything.

        Babe, it's cool.
     Elliot's okay with it.

266

  And I'll tweet, but only if
     I like it, all right?

267
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,518
   I only have 48 followers,
       but it's growing.

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,187
     - No doubt, no doubt.
- Some tastemakers in there so--

269
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:30,254
          I feel you,
          I feel you.

270
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,456
            - Yeah.
          - All right.

271
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,757
   Yo, I appreciate it, man,
            really.

272
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,258
  - You guys have a good day.
        - Yeah, you too.

273
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,526
       Thank you so much.
      Check track two out.

274
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,463
          - Track two.
       - All right, man.

275
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:39,998
      (Elliot voice-over)
This was never part of the plan.

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,233
          Data dumps?
     Releasing Terry Colby?

277
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:44,102
   None of this makes sense.

         with fsociety.

279
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,072
      Need to disconnect.

280
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,674
    We need to call in sick
      and lie low for a--

Don't stare at me!

285
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,463
      Why the hell are you
         in my shower?

286
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:14,499
Well, I was waiting
for you.

287
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,034
You were supposed
to come last night.

288
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:18,436
       - Did you forget?
         - Come? Where?

289
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,505
It's fine,
everyone's coming later.

                 [Darlene sighs]

291
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:29,347
      I'm stealing your clothes.

           has cum stains on it.

294

                Jesus, I am just
               messing with you.

295
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,723
                My stuff is just
                    in the wash.

296
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:41,659
           I'm gonna borrow this
             for the time being.

297
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:43,461
                 Oh, by the way,

298
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:46,064
                   your dog shat
                    on your bed.

299
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:49,133
                  You gotta walk
                     that thing.

    Hey, please take Flipper
          for a while.

301
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,238
She probably needs
a walk or something.

302
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,107
She keeps
shitting everywhere.

303
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,275
             Of course she needs
                 a walk, Elliot.

304
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:58,643
           She's a friggin' dog.

some froyo before we go.

00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:06,617
    Uh, I'll be back later.

308
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,687
          - I owe you.
       - Yeah, big time.

309
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,334
                 How do you know
                   where I live?

310
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,204
Why wouldn't I know
where you live?

311
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:30,708
                   I don't know.
    I don't know where you live.

312
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,643
Well,

313
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:36,481
I don't live anywhere
at the present.

00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:40,485
The douche I was dating
proposed to me, can you believe?

315
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,254
I mean, what an asshole.

316
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,857
Anyways, we got into
this huge fight, and--

317
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:47,758
      (Elliot voice-over)
   What the hell am I doing?

         batshit crazy.

        I gotta go back,
    tell Gideon everything.

320
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:53,664
    He'll understand, right?

321
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,133
     He'll know what to do.

322
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:57,335
It's whatevs.
He'll take me back.

323
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,669
    He's just gotta get over
           this whole

325

     I'll do my disappearing act
                   for a minute,

326
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,610
                  and then he'll
             come to his senses.

     Can she see them, too?

332
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:23,561
             What?

333
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:27,431
   I like to stay on my toes.

334
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:31,369
  Speaking of, that's, like, one
   of the most annoying things--

335
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:35,173
      (Elliot voice-over)
 But what if Tyrell finds out?
        What will he do?

336
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:37,475
    Shit, there's basically
      no scenario in which

337
00:19:37,477 --> 00:19:40,311
     I'm not getting killed
       or going to jail.

338

         and he was like, "No--"

 I might need to crash with you
    for a couple of nights.

  when you know that there's--

        For all we know,

     into a trap right now.

   I walk through that door.

00:22:24,377 --> 00:22:26,410
                sexism, fascism.

407
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:28,346
Trust me, we are gonna "ism"
so much all over them

408
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,947
they won't be able to
see straight.

409
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:32,116
 And asking for Colby's release
     as ransom was genius.

410
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:33,751
       That'll only make
     his spotlight bigger,

411
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,453
       keeping it off us.

412
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:38,356
     That neat little ditty
      was Trenton's idea.

413
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:40,558
She may look innocent,
but I'd be careful.

414
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,427
She's got some Allah Akbar
in her.

415
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,929
 And while all that's going on,

416
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:47,531
   you will use your Allsafe
       security clearance

417
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,934
          to hack the Comet PLC,
          increase the pressure,

418
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:51,802
                   causing a gas
              pipeline explosion

419
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,637
     making Steel Mountain
          go kablooey

420
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:55,706
  along with Evil Corp's soul.

421
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:03,080
   They know about all this?

422
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:05,015
You're the first.

423
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,720
            Workers?

424
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,088
      Anyone living around
          the plant...

425
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,890
         They all die?

426
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,692
We'll give them a head start.

427
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,762
Sound some alarms.
They'll be fine.

428
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:21,832
You're blowing up
a gas pipeline.

429
00:23:21,834 --> 00:23:23,934
          The world is
   a dangerous place, Elliot,

430
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,636
      not because of those
          who do evil,

431
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,805
      but because of those
  who look on and do nothing.

432
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:28,973
                   This is war.

433
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:31,175
People will die.
C'est la mort.

434
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,412
      And once we blow up
         the pipeline,

435
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:36,647
    Darlene's worm will kick
         into high gear

436
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,416
    at the U.S. data center

437
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:42,086
which you helped to us install,
      thank you very much.

438
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:45,689
  The redundant backups at their
  eastern data center in China--

439
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,058
   the Dark Army is covering
          us on that.

440
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:51,061
Dark Army?
Why, man?

441
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,830
They got no code.
They hack for anyone:

442
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,698
terrorists, North Korea,
Iran, Russia--

443
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,066
     Which means they hate
        U.S. capitalism

444
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:59,937
    just as much as anyone.

445
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,907
      Last but not least.

446
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,575
        Steel Mountain.

447
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,645
     The hacker's dilemma.
           What to do

448
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,547
      when a bunch of data
      you want to destroy

449
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,715
       is completely off
           the grid?

450
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,017
               [explosion noise]

451
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,890
I'm not killing anyone.

452
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,028
              Tell me one thing,
                         Elliot.

453
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,096
                   Are you a one
                      or a zero?

454
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,500
That's the question
you have to ask yourself.

455
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,635
Are you a yes or a no?

456
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,572
Are you going to act or not?

457
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,144
    Yo...you've been staring
      at a computer screen

458
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:42,480
      way too long, homie.

459
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,081
    Life's not that binary.

460
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:46,050
Isn't it?

461
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:48,486
Sure, there are grays--

462
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:50,588
but when you come right down
to it, at its core,

463
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,592
beneath every choice,
there's either a one or a zero.

464
00:24:54,594 --> 00:24:57,695
You either do something
or you don't.

465
00:24:57,697 --> 00:25:00,231
You walk out that door,
you've decided to do nothing,

466
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:04,101
to say no, which means
you do not come back.

467
00:25:04,103 --> 00:25:07,571
You leave, you are no longer
a part of this.

468
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:10,508
       You become a zero.

469
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,109
          If you stay,

470
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,212
if you want to change the world,

471
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,014
       you become a yes.

472
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:20,184
You become a one.

473
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:22,520
So, I'll ask you again:

474
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,756
are you a one or a zero?

475
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:27,925
  An innocent man is in prison
     because of what I did.

476
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:29,527
              Come on, let's not
                  kid ourselves!

477
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:33,030
          This has nothing to do
                     with Colby.

478
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:37,968
           This isn't even about
                  my revolution.

479
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,704
This is more than that
for you.

480
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,641
This is about how those bastards
   slowly killed your father

481
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,175
and how you wished he'd done
something about it.

482
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:48,112
But he didn't.
Because he was a zero,

483
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:50,781
just like you're being
right now.

484
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,785
           F--- you.

485
00:25:57,689 --> 00:26:00,691
             Disappearing again?

486
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,763
    I'm not killing anyone.
     Leave me out of this.

487
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:10,100
      You don't get to disappear
                      from this.

488
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,635
               We can do it with
                 or without you,

489
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,837
               but you're a part
               of it either way!

490
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,974
   Yeah, even your stupid hoodie
       can't protect you, bitch!

491
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:18,609
      (Elliot voice-over)
      This was a mistake.

492
00:26:18,611 --> 00:26:20,177
    I've gotta turn them in.
     Should I turn them in?

493
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:22,613
    Will I get into trouble?
       Shit, she's right.

494
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,182
       I'm culpable now.
      No, we're culpable.

495
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:28,319
You're in this with me, so start
   thinking of solutions now.

                     Yo, Shayla.

498
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,702
Yo, bro.

499
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:47,171
Can I help you
with something?

500
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:53,210
            I, uh...just need to
                 talk to Shayla.

501
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,179
Oh, your girl.

502
00:26:55,181 --> 00:26:57,247

in a minute.

00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,728
Can sit and wait
if you want.

506
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,631
 I think we should check on her,
      make sure she's all right.

00:27:13,633 --> 00:27:16,033

       You a funny dude.
          I like you.

509
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:22,039
         Don't be rude.

510
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,975
      Sit down and chill.

511
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,262
No, that's right.

512
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,267
You only do this.

withdrawal meds while he using.

514
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,440

Probably even convinced
yourself you ain't an addict.

00:27:59,311 --> 00:28:02,112
[laughs]
Oh, shit.

517
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:04,314
Forgot to introduce myself.
I'm Fernan--

518
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,316
      (Elliot voice-over)
         Fernando Vera,
       Shayla's supplier.

519
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,452
 One of the worst human beings
       I've ever hacked.

520
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:12,222
         His password?
        "eatadick6969."

521
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,158
     Aside from the massive
        amounts of money

522
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,893
 he spends on porn and webcams,

523
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,127
          he does all
     his drug transactions

524
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:19,363
 through emails, IMs, Twitter.

525
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,999
 The fact that the cops haven't
  caught him yet is beyond me.

526
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,801
 If they had half a brain cell,

527
00:28:23,803 --> 00:28:26,203
    they'd be able to crack
  his gang's simplistic code,

528
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,338
 if it can even be called that.

529
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,708
     After only a couple of
   hours of timing his tweets

530
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,076
  with related news articles,

531
00:28:32,078 --> 00:28:34,011
  I figured out that "biscuit"
         and "clickety"

532
00:28:34,013 --> 00:28:35,879
    clearly referenced guns.

533
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,849
 "Food," "sea shells" or "gas"
          for bullets.

534
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,485
       And the ultimate:
     "rock to sleep early."

535
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,787
   I haven't made the direct
    connection to a hit yet,

536
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:45,489
        but the math of
       guns plus bullets

537
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,791
 usually adds up to one thing.

538
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,226
       I've thought about
        turning him in,

539
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:51,361
but he's Shayla's only supplier.

540
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,797
        I take him down,
        I lose my drugs,

541
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:57,067
  and with everything going on
 right now, I can't have that.

542
00:28:57,069 --> 00:28:59,803
     You get that, though?
           [inhales]

543
00:28:59,805 --> 00:29:02,005
            [laughs]
          Anyway, bro,

544
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:05,142
       I ain't nothing to
          worry about.

545
00:29:05,144 --> 00:29:08,746
       Just making a drop
            for you.

546
00:29:08,748 --> 00:29:10,214
   What's your name, anyway?

547
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,984
    Elliot.

548
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,786
             (Vera)
         What it mean?

549
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,455
What, you ain't
never Googled it?

550
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:20,124
Man, you gotta do that.

551
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:22,326
The meaning of a person's name
is important, bro.

552
00:29:22,328 --> 00:29:25,829
Yo, she good!
She good.

553
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,368
Trust me.

554
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:34,438
Took care of
that shit myself.

555
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:41,178
      You remind me of me
      when I was younger,

556
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,280
     depressed and sullen.

557
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:47,251
Matter of fact, tried to
kill myself, a couple of times.

558
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:49,419
        Never could get
        that shit right.

559
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:52,289
         Biology wasn't
        my strong suit.

560
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:56,160
I hated myself, man.
Still do.

561
00:29:56,162 --> 00:29:59,096
Thought that shit was
a weakness for a long time.

562
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,106
   Then I realized that shit
         was my power.

563
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:12,009
People walk around, act like
they know what hate means.

564
00:30:12,011 --> 00:30:16,380
       Nah, no one does,
    until you hate yourself.

565
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:19,016
           I mean...

566
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:21,919
      truly hate yourself.

567
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,954
         That's power.

568
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:41,471
You ain't scared of me,
are you?

569
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,473
That's good.

570
00:30:43,475 --> 00:30:46,310
Means I didn't waste my time
making friends with you.

571
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,846
[chuckles]

572
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,014
  You don't really need these,
            do you?

573
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:55,519
Man of your courage can last
through a little withdrawal.

574
00:30:55,521 --> 00:31:00,123
Ya know, you the only reason
why I met Shayla.

575
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:03,260
I'm the only nigga in town
carrying everything,

576
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,629
including your precious
Suboxone.

577
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:09,566
So, in a weird way,
I should be thanking you.

578
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:11,235
You brought her to me.

579
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:14,238
Your star orbiting with mine,
gravitationally,

580
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,574
brought me the love
of my life, Elliot.

581
00:31:17,576 --> 00:31:19,509
I mean, this, us?

582
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,378
          Being here?

583
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,647
          This has...

584
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:26,216
       beautiful meaning.

585
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,953
      But make no mistake,
     that girl in there...

586
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,189
            is mine.

587
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:34,925
       I don't know what
      I'd do without her.

588
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:37,361
       Now, I don't know
    what kind of arrangement

589
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:43,100
    you had with her before,
   but now that we friends...

590
00:31:43,102 --> 00:31:45,936
      I trust you respect
         this boundary.

591
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:48,005
Feel me?

592
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,915
           [chuckles]

593
00:31:57,917 --> 00:32:00,684
  A dude earlier today gave me
        that same look.

594
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:03,020
   Only thing I gotta say is,

595
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:05,656
   there's a smart time to be
         scared, bro...

596
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,993
And a stupid time.

[door closes]

598
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,700
            Shayla?

      (Elliot voice-over)
         The lock pick.

600
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,970
 Every hacker's favorite sport.

601
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,305
  The perfect system to crack,

602
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:23,307
         mostly because
    unlike virtual systems,

603
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:25,242
       when you break it,
        you can feel it.

604
00:32:25,244 --> 00:32:26,576
        You can see it.
        You can hear it.

        [metal clatters]

                         Shayla.

607
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,422
                            Hey.

608
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:40,057
                         Shayla.

609
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,659
                        Wake up.

610
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:45,462
              Mm.

611
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,165
         What happened?

612
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,201
                       You okay?

613
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:53,303
                         Why was
              that asshole here?

614
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,238
      Why am I in the tub?

615
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:08,452
            (Shayla)
 I don't He came over.told him
      We smoked a little..

616
00:33:08,454 --> 00:33:10,253
You remember having sex
with him?

617
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,590
             What?
              No.

618
00:33:13,592 --> 00:33:15,292
      (Elliot voice-over)
    But he definitely does.

619
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,560
                 Okay, let's go.

620
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,595
 - Get your purse, make sure--
            - Stop.

621
00:33:18,597 --> 00:33:22,299
    I'm not going anywhere,
             okay?

622
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:23,667
       What do you mean?

623
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,003
      Oh, he's just gonna
       get away with it?

624
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,639
   You can't go back to him.
  Hey, I don't need the pills.

625
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,709
   - Just find someone else.
           - I can't.

626
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:40,417
      He gives me a really
    good deal on the split.

627
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,285
       I make good money.

628
00:33:42,287 --> 00:33:44,121
      (Elliot voice-over)
       There it is again,

629
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,123
  the invisible hand at work,
        controlling us,

630
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:49,126
      even if it pushes us
  past our threshold of pain.

631
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:52,295
It's not gonna stop.

632
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,264
What if he does it again?

633
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,734
      Promise me you won't
          do anything?

634
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,803
      I'm serious, Elliot.

635
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,806
        There's nothing
        to be done here.

636
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:05,275
 It's not like I have a choice.

637
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,345
Hey...

638
00:34:08,347 --> 00:34:11,348
    Would you mind sleeping
         here tonight?

639
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:17,587
      (Elliot voice-over)
            Choices.

640
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,790
    Maybe Mr. Robot's right.

641
00:34:19,792 --> 00:34:24,061
 That's what this is all about,
  the yesses and nos of life.

642
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:27,597
     But do we decide them
     or do they decide us?

643
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,067
         Fernando Vera.
       I get rid of him,

644
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,202
          I get rid of
   my drug dealer's supplier.

645
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:34,071
   I get rid of the morphine.

646
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:37,441
     And the pain I've been
 holding in comes rushing out.

647
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:39,309
    Sure, I can try to find
        another dealer,

648
00:34:39,311 --> 00:34:42,345
   but like Vera said, no one
 on the streets deals Suboxone.

649
00:34:42,347 --> 00:34:44,681
  I could go back to digitally
    counterfeiting scripts,

650
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,717
but pharmas spend a lot of dough
    protecting their wares.

651
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,220
     Most places only take
         paper scripts.

652
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,556
      Continuously getting
 legit refills isn't realistic,

653
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:54,624
 and neither is being a junkie.

654
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:58,595
     So I quit cold turkey
       or let Vera exist.

655
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:01,631
  I know what you're thinking.
   The answer's too obvious.

656
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,234
   Vera may have been groping
         Shayla before,

657
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,203
  but he's graduated to rape.

658
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:13,343
       Just like Shayla,
    he's left me no choice.

659
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:16,413
      He can't be allowed
       to exist anymore.

660
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,429
            (Krista)
    Perhaps we should start
    with how you're feeling.

661
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:38,535
Not good.

662
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:42,472
                 What's not good
                      right now?

663
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:43,673
Everything.

664
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,578
         Humor me with
        some specifics.

665
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:58,755
How do we know if
we're in control?

666
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:01,925
That we're not just
making the best

667
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:05,195
of what comes at us,
and that's it.

668
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:09,266
Trying to constantly pick
between two options.

669
00:36:09,268 --> 00:36:13,236
    Like your two paintings
      in the waiting room.

673
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:28,685
              Hmm.

674
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:33,256
        It's all part of
     the same blur, right?

675
00:36:33,258 --> 00:36:36,293
   Just out of focus enough.

676
00:36:36,295 --> 00:36:38,728
  It's the illusion of choice.

677
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,898
           Half of us
   can't even pick our own--

   our cable, gas, electric.

679
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:49,773
      The water we drink,
     our health insurance.

680
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:52,976
Even if we did, would it matter?

681
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:56,479
  You know, if our only option
 is Blue Cross or Blue Shield,

682
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,416
         what the f---
       is the difference?

     In fact, aren't they--
     aren't they the same?

685
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,927
           No, man...

687
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:18,335
         long time ago.

00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:21,438
       I'm sorry you feel
      you have no control.

689
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:28,778
      Thought I was doing
        something good.

690
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,350
    I was a part of this...
            project.

691
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:37,320
   Thought I was going to be
  a part of something special.

692
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:43,526
            And now?

693
00:37:43,528 --> 00:37:46,496
             Now...

694
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,032
      It turned out to be
           a mistake,

695
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:51,534
     like everything else.

696
00:37:51,536 --> 00:37:56,473
    What's the point, right?

697
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:59,743
     Might as well, just--
        you do nothing.

698
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:03,513
   Might as well do nothing.

699
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:05,515
       You've brought up
       this issue before,

700
00:38:05,517 --> 00:38:08,518
 this issue of not feeling like
       you're in control.

701

        Do you remember?

702
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,293
When we spoke about your father.

703
00:38:16,295 --> 00:38:18,695
      You talked about how
     he chose to do nothing

704
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,431
      when he was battling
          his cancer.

705
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:22,899
   You told him he could have

706
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,534
       fought the company
        that caused it.

707

      in new technologies

00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,624
     and develop prototypes
     in order to understand

20
00:00:58,626 --> 00:01:00,092
   the technology potential,

21
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:02,294
        because despite
       the recent success

22
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,196
  of our cyber security team,

   you stupid piece of shit.

00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,808
             Again.

          Our company

      Now is not the time
        to be encumbered

32
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:28,454
    by the company's tragic

      Now is not the time
        to be encumbered

38

    by the company's tragic
       and shameful loss

39
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,767
of our chief technology officer.

40
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:45,170
      We have to be swift
 in naming the replacement CTO,

41
00:01:45,172 --> 00:01:48,807
     and, sir, I would like
      to suggest it be me.

42
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,880
  For the sake of our company,

43
00:01:54,882 --> 00:01:57,883
that we make our decision today,

44
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,219
         my promotion--

45
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:06,225
     My internal promotion
 shows not only our confidence

46
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:10,562
   as a company, but strength
 in our boldness to the public.

47
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:14,399
    Thank you for your time.

48
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,536
    You will be the next CTO
        of this company.

00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:20,806
          You will be
 the next CTO of this company.

You will be the next CTO

      Sir, thank you again
         for seeing me.

54
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:40,692
     Tyrell, I'm gonna have
      to reschedule this.

55
00:02:40,694 --> 00:02:42,694
 - Anwar, set up another time.
- Sir, it's just that I think--

56
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,396
      I get it, I get it.

57
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,431
   We'll get another meeting
    on the books right away.

58
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:50,235
           We've got
  a really good CTO candidate

59
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,804
the board is very excited about.

60
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,841
       They're not ready
       to discuss it yet.

       We'll loop you in.

    a couple of weeks, hmm?

                 Uh, put Wellick
              back on the books.

         Great taste, as always.

                        Be well.

00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:16,461
   I'll email your assistant
          the details.

If you could,

72
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:24,303
      just email it to me
           directly.

73

     This is too important

91
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:01,793
            (Elliot)
       Most coders think
       debugging software

92
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,995
        is about fixing
           a mistake,

93
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,064
      but that's bullshit.

94
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,534
      Debugging's actually
   all about finding the bug,

95
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:13,038
about understanding why the bug
    was there to begin with,

96
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,875
       about knowing that
 its existence was no accident.

97
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:19,678
         It came to you
     to deliver a message,

98
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,415
   like an unconscious bubble
    floating to the surface,

99
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:27,419
   popping with a revelation
you've secretly known all along.

100
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,888
        I don't know why
    I'm saying all of this.

101
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,157
       Maybe it's because
I'm pumped up on whatever sm---

104
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:39,798

  there's a sense it's coming.

108
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,876
 Or maybe I'm just freaking out
    because I never thought

00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:54,479
   I'd wake up to find these

             You don't remember?

117
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:20,439
They said I was

118

                      Um, right.

119
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:27,746
               Um, you told them
      to call your psychiatrist.

120
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,215
You can't leave
until you talk to one.

121
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,484
So I'm gonna wait outside.

00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,620
              Hey.

123
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,894
Do you remember
requesting me from the staff?

124
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,568
You requested me
because the police said that--

                    I got jumped

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,574
                It's not the end
                   of the world.

127
00:07:55,576 --> 00:07:58,577
They wanted to do a full
drug panel, and you refused.

128
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:00,712
May I ask why?

129
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,251
Elliot, if we can't have
a conversation about this...

130
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,555
      I've been taking morphine.

131
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,495
Why?

132
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:22,667
      I don't have a good enough
             reason to give you.

133
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,570
                   I wish I did,
                    but I don't.

134
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,141
Maybe we should
consider rehab.

               I'm not a junkie.

00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:51,796
    he is the IT department.

145
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,565
      He's also an idiot,

146
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:55,834
  not that I blame him because
   the people that hired him

147
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,969
        are also idiots.

148
00:08:57,971 --> 00:09:01,806
The poor guy only gets a budget
  of about 7,000 bucks a year,

149
00:09:01,808 --> 00:09:03,575
  and he's supposed to protect
         their network

150

    He never stood a chance.

152
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:09,881
  He uses useless virus scans,
         dated servers,

     and security software
    that runs on Windows 98.

          Like I said,

168
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,999
    the most difficult thing
        about debugging

169
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:02,734
     isn't fixing the bug.

170
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,236
         It's all about
        finding the bug.

171
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:09,274
    For Evil Corp, Mr. Robot
     found their bug in me.

172
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:13,211
       I was the mistake
    that led to all of this.

173
00:10:13,213 --> 00:10:14,946
            (Shayla)
  I have to ask you one thing.

174
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,384
Did you have something
to do with Vera getting busted?

175
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,219
                   Shit, Elliot.

176
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:23,989
            You said you weren't
              gonna do anything.

177
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,124
         He's on murder charges,
               do you know that?

178
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,993
         His whole crew bounced.

179
00:10:27,995 --> 00:10:30,762
       I mean, I don't know what
     I'm gonna do for money now.

180
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:33,231
           Just tell me, Elliot,

181
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:35,133
                  and don't lie.

182
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,102
           Did you do something?

183
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:39,170
No.

184
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,175
              Hmm.

185
00:10:44,177 --> 00:10:46,311
             - Hey.
           - [sighs]

186
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,280
Hey.

187
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,850
Are you okay?

188
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,685
I mean, with everything
that happened--

189
00:10:53,687 --> 00:10:57,088
           I'm fine.

190
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,190
         What happened
         to your door?

191
00:11:02,428 --> 00:11:04,162
             You're not supposed
               to be here, okay?

192
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,764
             I changed the locks
                   for a reason.

193
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:08,199
Mmm.

194
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,402
        Interesting toy,

195
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,671
but you may want to
spend a little more scratch

196
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,873
if you actually want it to,
you know,

197
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,941
             work.

198
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,376
           Check it.

199
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:21,813
  Jessica Alba says she wants
       to join fsociety.

200
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,917
      Jesus, what happened
         to your face?

201
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,986
        What's going on?

202
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,125
Well, I am not the princess
of social graces,

203
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:35,960
but typically it goes
something like,

204
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,963
    - "Hi, this is Darlene."
            - Stop.

205
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,366
       You need to leave.

206
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,002
    Babe, seriously, we have
   a lot of shit to discuss,

207
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:45,036
so if you wouldn't mind...

208
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,738
            Get out.

209
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,145
            [scoffs]

210
00:11:58,084 --> 00:12:00,218
       I suggest you get a grip.

211
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:07,292
What was she
talking about?

212
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:08,960
           I got to get to work.

213
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,895
Work?
Are you serious?

214
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,198
     You can't go to work.
   You have to call in sick.

215
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,935
                   I have to go.

216
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:20,505
            (Elliot)
 A bug is never just a mistake.

217
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:23,208
    It represents something
            bigger.

218
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,282
     An error of thinking.

219
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,018
        - Sir! Sir! Sir!
 - That makes you who you are.

220
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:37,889
              Sir!
    You dropped your wallet.

221
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:40,759
           - Thanks.
            - Stop!

222
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:42,293
Stop!
He stole my purse.

223
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,828
           That was your wallet?

224
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,865
Yes, that was my wallet
you just gave him.

225
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:50,168
                           Stop!

226
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,836
            (Ollie)
     He got into my system,
        and he wants me

227
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:53,371
      to put the CD on one
   of the computers at work.

228
00:12:53,373 --> 00:12:57,108
 - Why does he want to do that?
    - I don't know, Stella.

229
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,409
       He didn't give me
      a full explanation.

230
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,211
            (Stella)
 So he's got naked pics of me?

231
00:13:00,213 --> 00:13:01,479
     Is that the only thing
  you're seriously taking away

232
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,480
    from this conversation?

233
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:05,183
            [sighs]

234
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:06,885
Hey, babe.

235
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,320
             - Hey.
      - How was your run?

236
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,789
                        Strange.

237
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,323
   Someone dropped their wallet,

238
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:15,426
   and I picked it up to give it
        to them, but then this--

239
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:17,028
Nothing strange about that--
just shows how good

240
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,196
of a person you are.

241
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,564
Always have been.

242
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,434
Almost to a fault.

243
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:25,036
            What does that mean?

244
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:28,907
       [phone vibrating]
       - Just that you--

245
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,911
        you're too good
         for the world.

246
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:37,482
      That's probably why
          I love you.

247
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:41,052
  I'm gonna hop in the shower.

248
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,454
        [phone vibrates]

249
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,190
          [whispering]
    I told you I can't talk.

250
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,892
       (distorted voice)
 You have 100 hours precisely.

251
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:52,897
 After that, everything we own
       will be released.

252
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,900
         [tense music]

253
00:13:55,902 --> 00:14:04,008
              â™ª

254
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:23,561
 not enough
  just to focus your attention
          on the logs.

255
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:25,563
     We should also monitor
      social media traffic

256
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,432
   as well as IRC, Pastebin.

257
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:30,168
       And set up scripts
      to keep going 24/7.

258
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,036
        I mean, we might
           get lucky.

259
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,572
     They might get sloppy,
  make a mistake, you know...

260
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,908
            (Elliot)
 This is the world we live in.

261
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,277
         People relying
    on each other's mistakes

262
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,614
   to manipulate one another
      and use one another,

263
00:14:42,616 --> 00:14:44,916
  even relate to one another.

264
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,352
      A warm, messy circle
          of humanity.

265
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,888
            Elliot.

266
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,357
     I'm inviting you guys
       to dinner tonight.

267
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,260
Morton's notwithstanding,
I cook a mean steak.

268
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,934
What? Can't a boss invite his
favorite employees to dinner?

269
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:06,404
        No, that's cool,
        but I got plans.

270
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,011
Can you guys give us
a minute?

271
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,647
             Yeah.

272
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,287
      You want to tell me
        what's going on?

273
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:24,055
         - Not really.
             - Oh.

274
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,623
      You're missing work,
 you come in looking like that,

275
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:28,693
     and you expect me not
       to ask questions?

276
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,528
Look, I don't know how much
you want me asking

277
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,063
about your personal life,
but--

278
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,998
           Not at all, actually.

279
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,436
            I mean, I don't mean
                     to be rude.

280
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:42,006
                         I was--
          I'm just being honest.

281
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,948
            (Elliot)
    Mr. Robot may have found
        Evil Corp's bug,

282
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,216
    but he didn't find mine.

283
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:55,286
      That's the only way
       to protect myself.

284
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,322
        Never show them
        my source code.

285
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,290
       Close myself off.

286
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,192
  Create my cold, perfect maze

287
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,595
          where no one
       can ever find me.

288
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:06,564
    Elliot, I cannot believe
         you work here.

289
00:16:06,566 --> 00:16:08,733
   This place is a shithole.

290
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,402
   Look, I thought I'd swing by,
              take you to lunch.

291
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:15,340
                Oh, that's nice.

292
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:17,475
          I think she likes you,
                            bud.

293
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,210
                All right, fine,
                  I'll take her,

294
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,479
   but let the record show I was
    trying to be a good wingman.

295
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,982
                  Oh, calm down.
                           Shit.

296
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:25,550
                    I'm not that
           into redheads anyway.

297
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,419
     The whole nation of Ireland
             makes my dick soft.

298
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,454
             Leave.

299
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,588
            Darlene said we need
                        to talk.

300
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,323
           Leave now.

301
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,591
                   You're right.
   Probably shouldn't talk here.

302
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,193
            Let's go to that bar
                      next door.

303
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:36,594
     I'm not going anywhere
           with you.

304
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:38,529
          I'm not going anywhere
                   until you do,

305
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:40,732
          so I can hang out here
             and create a scene,

306
00:16:40,734 --> 00:16:42,467
 or you can give me five minutes
           at the bar next door.

307
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,068
                     Either way,
             I'm gonna have fun.

308
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,137

         with a binder.

31
00:02:01,053 --> 00:02:05,557
   If HVAC conditions surpass
    the ceiling 95 degrees,

32
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:09,160
polyurethane adhesive mollifies
  and tape data is unreadable.

   This is what we're doing.

37
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:35,787
This circuit board, if installed
      behind a thermostat,

38
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:38,156
        it lets us plant
    an asymmetric back door

39
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,027
       then create a VPN
in the Steel Mountain intranet.

40
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:44,896
               Okay, we all know
        what a raspberry pie is.

41
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,565
              What's your point?

42
00:02:48,634 --> 00:02:50,235

                Steel Mountain's

43
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,670
         climate control system,

44
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:53,805
raise the facility's heat
high enough

45
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,708
to destroy all the tapes.

46
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,777
     And you think sticking
   this behind the thermostat

47
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:01,780
       will do all that?

48
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,215
         With the right software
          specifically designed.

49
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:06,117
    I'll pull up my research
        on the facility,

50
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,619
        start targeting
       which thermostats

51
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,954
    are the most accessible.

52
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,288
              Yeah, well, that's
              all well and good,

53
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:12,657
          but we still gotta get
              in the damn joint.

54
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,995
            (Romero)
             There.
    Deep in the Adirondacks.

55
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:20,265
In 145-plus acre
former limestone mine.

56
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:24,903
3-ton steel gates,
24/7 armed guards,

closed circuit cameras,
NOC staffing.

             to just blow it up?

          All we need
     is one security flaw.

61
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,887
Look at this place, man.
It was built not to have any.

62
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,226
I see about...
six walking around.

63
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:54,032
        [coughs]

64
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:58,970

Where you going?

68
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:08,747
     We're done, aren't we?

69
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,349
      (Elliot, voice-over)
    That was about the time
    the withdrawal started.

70
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,851
           Remember?

71
00:04:16,922 --> 00:04:19,658
  I know--I broke my own rule.

72
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,426
    But I have no Suboxone.

73
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:25,330
    What I do have--clinical
  depression, social anxiety.

74
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:28,967
    A day job, a night job,
    confusing relationships.

75
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,069

    Taking down the largest
   corporation in the world.

77
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,145
 This line has wanted to own me
         my whole life.

78
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:43,882
   Biosynthesized in some lab
 in Mexico, packed into a pill,

79
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:45,884
     shipped to the States
     where it was packaged

80
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,153
     with a logo and taxed
       by the government,

81
00:04:48,155 --> 00:04:51,056
   stolen by a bribed guard,
    sold to a Vera henchman,

82
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:54,192
      oversold to Shayla,
        and then to me.

83
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:57,762
  It needs me just as much as
           I need it.

84
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,065
    The moment was destined,
    every choice bringing me

85

    closer to this one line.

86

        This last line.

88
00:05:16,882 --> 00:05:18,817
    Today will be the worst
             of it.

89
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,120
  Get through the next couple
 days, and then I'll be clean.

95
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,015
              I would have saved
        you the trip to the door

96
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:27,085
but you're all, like, against me
        breaking in or whatever.

97
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:32,490
       Why are you here?

98
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,459
         Romero got some clarity
             on your little plan

99
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,127
               that's gonna need
                 your undivided.

100
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:40,865
       - Okay, let's go.
  - What's going on with you?

101
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:42,267
             You look like shit.

102
00:06:43,435 --> 00:06:45,336
           I'm fine.

104
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:58,416
           Look, man.
  This plan's not gonna work.

105
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:01,352
               Why? Why is that?

106
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:02,954
       I was doing recon
       on Steel Mountain.

107
00:07:02,956 --> 00:07:04,355
    Came up with a problem.
        A big, fat one.

108
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,492
       Evil Corp's upping
    their security protocol.

109
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:11,229
 If you ask me, it's overkill,
        but it's legit.

110
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,431
             I already told you,
they have their vulnerabilities.

111
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,367
 So what happens after we hack
     the New York facility?

112
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,203
Then we have to take
a trip to Nashville,

113
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:20,572
then Colorado,
then San Jose,

114
00:07:20,574 --> 00:07:23,107
   then goddamn Tallahassee.

115
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,512
   Ugh, this looks real bad.
           Real bad.

116
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:29,581
They are physically
copying then shipping

117
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,382
all the analog backups.

118
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:34,385
Five big-ass fortress-like
redundancies across the country.

119
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,322
Now maybe--and it was
always a big maybe--

120
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,457
we get into one, but no way
we get into all of them.

121
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,993
The minute we fry
one facility,

122
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:45,196
they'll patch every climate
control system they own.

123
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,498
No matter how you slice it,
the plan is DOA.

124
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,367
           Where'd you get this?

125
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,635
What the hell do you mean?

126
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:54,239
We're still
in Evil Corp's network.

127
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:57,075
                        [softly]
                           Shit.

128
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,410
             This is what Tyrell
              was talking about.

129
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:02,313
What'd you just say?
Tyrell?

130
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,183
As in Tyrell Wellick?

131
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,619
             Yeah.

132
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:10,088
Since when did you
and the goddamn CTO

133
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,591
of Evil Corp become,
what, chums?

134
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,961
   Says this isn't happening
        till April 1st.

135
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,298
      It's only the 29th.

136
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,400
    We still got a few days.

137
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,502
         We have time.

138
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,672
   All their tapes are still
   in the New York facility.

139
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,276
   Just means we go up today.

140
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:37,081
      We're nowhere close
        to being ready.

141
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,617
Well, I've already downloaded
all the necessary PDFs

142
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,320
of the floor plans
to target the thermostats.

143
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:43,488
It will require
some planning,

144
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,123
but nothing I can't do
in the car.

145
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:46,357
            It shouldn't take me
                     long to own

146
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,259
                  the facility's
                  SCADA network.

147
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,595
                 Especially with
                      some help.

148
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:54,365
    while Trenton helps <i>me </i>
       <i>finish the distro.</i>

149
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,134
     We'll double-time it.

150
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:58,169
      You can get it off the FTP
server as soon as you get there.

151
00:08:58,171 --> 00:08:59,604
       What about China?

152
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,472
      We'd have to execute
    the hack before Tuesday.

153
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,341
        Don't worry about China.

154
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:06,244
        I'll hit up my Dark Army
contact as soon as you take off.

155
00:09:06,246 --> 00:09:08,079
   Oh, you just gonna hit up

156
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,983
   the world's most dangerous
          hacker crew?

157
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:16,387
   Pssh, ya'll have gone and
misplaced your collective minds.

158
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,523
      We've been planning
        this for months.

159
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:21,059
Now we're gonna go up on a lark
    just 'cause he said so?

160
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:24,095
       This plan is shit.

161
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,964
            (Elliot)
      The plan will work.

162
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,232
  And once we're actually there,
            I still need to prep

163
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,501
         the social engineering,
            plus we have no idea

164
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:33,037
   who physically's gonna go in.

165
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:40,511
It's my plan.
I'll go in.

166
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:43,581
       Look, man, you...

167
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,249
  you might be able to hide it
       from these nerds,

168
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,719
      but I know a junkie
        when I see one.

169
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:49,988
       In your condition,
you ain't gonna do Jack or Jill

170
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,456
          except puke
        your brains out

171
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,391
       or give hand jobs
       for another high.

172
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:57,095
Like you said, in three days,
one Steel Mountain becomes five.

173
00:09:57,097 --> 00:10:00,164
That's no good for any plan.

174
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:04,535
Something ain't right
about this guy.

175
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:08,106
          Yeah, well.
    He's gotten us this far.

176
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,108
Still, I don't trust him.

to brunch.

    what he wants anyway, right?

259
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,799
               And I'll tell him
                 you stopped by.

    we just kind of wing it

266
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,058

      the moment takes us.

    Don't let me down, okay?

22
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,516
     That girl in there is mine.

23
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,484
            (Shayla)
     Did you have something
to do with Vera getting busted?

24
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:54,520
    He's on murder charges.
       Do you know that?

25
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,355
It's my plan.
I'll go in.

26
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,123
       You might be able
  to hide it from these nerds,

27
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,092
      but I know a junkie
        when I see one.

    I wish I had better news
       for you, Fernando,

32
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:31,690
         but this isn't
the you're-getting-out meeting.

33
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:35,794
      This is only as much
       as I could carry.

34
00:01:35,796 --> 00:01:37,229
       The D.A. has more.

00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:40,799
    How long this gonna be?

36
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,435
      We're talking years.

00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,636
                Yo, you playing?

38
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:46,605
    You get our people out.

39
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,307
     That's your use to us.

40
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,109
They have a solid case.

41
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:51,610
For every charge
they're gonna lay on you,

42
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,847
they have these binders,
your Twitters, your Instagram.

43
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,318
You said they wouldn't
figure this shit out.

44

(Manny)
They can't, brah.

45
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:02,554
I'm telling you,
it was airtight, V.

46
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,557
       Fellas, this isn't
      the imitation game.

47
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,226
         The code here
    is not that complicated.

48
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:09,194
     Besides, who told you
      to put your business

49
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:11,630
  anywhere near social media?

50
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:14,766
                 My aspirational
                 little brother.

51
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:18,770
You know how much money
we saved last year?

52
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,206
Made our whole operation
way more efficient.

53
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,574
We were careful.

54
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:23,909
          You tweeted
    about every transaction

55
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:25,210
 your business was involved in.

56
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:27,746
That is the opposite of careful.

57
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:31,450
         It's no wonder
an anonymous tip turned you in.

58
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:32,684
          Who called in the tip?

59
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:35,287
     This is what is meant
         by anonymous.

60
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,222
    It is now spilled milk.

61
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,841
    The information got out,

62
00:02:38,842 --> 00:02:40,459
            and now
   they're coming down hard.

63
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,560
 There's no plea on the table.

64
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,195
         They're gonna
     lay murder one on you.

65
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:44,630
I ain't pleading anyway.

66
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:45,898
Men can't sentence me.

67
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,467
That is
a cosmic responsibility.

68
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:53,705
Someone's gonna
get hurt for this.

69
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,807
    That's how we get square
       with the universe.

70
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:58,243
               Fernando, we need
            to discuss strategy.

71
00:02:58,245 --> 00:02:59,478

         don't matter.

        Steel Mountain.

95
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,021
   We're trying to penetrate
    a data security facility

96
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,456
 whose tagline literally is...

97
00:04:57,398 --> 00:04:59,498
           Nothing is
     actually impenetrable.

98
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,800
 A place like this says it is,
        and it's close,

99
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,770
           but people
    still built this place.

100
00:05:04,772 --> 00:05:06,038
      And if you can hack
       the right person,

101
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,472
        all of a sudden,

102
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,808
        you have a piece
      of powerful malware.

103
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,544
         People always
    make the best exploits.

00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:15,447

      to hack most people.

         Bill Harper is
       our first exploit.

113
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,432
 He isn't gonna give the search
         much scrutiny.

114
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,683
He'll get us to Level 1,

to get us to Level 2.

116
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,936

                     to Level 2.

117
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:40,672
       You're gonna ask to speak
       to his supervisor, Wendy.

118
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,674
        She'll get us to exactly
            where we need to be.

119
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,710
              Then we'll be able
 to get rid of her from the van.

120
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:47,079
                     After that,
    you connect the Raspberry Pi

121
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,548
  to the climate control system,
           and Bob's your uncle.

122
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,489
      Now we can hear you,
      and you can hear us.

00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,726
          His flaw is
    he's absolutely insane.

    We're talking clinical.

When they say, "If your friends
 jump off a bridge, would you?"

127
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,965
 he would, without hesitation,

128
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:08,534
    just to prove something.

129
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:10,102
 He goes in there, he's liable
  to blow the whole place up,

130
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,571
     just like he wanted to
      in the first place.

131
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,740
     Sure you don't want to look
over the info and the map again?

00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,441

        Yes, I also have

00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,152
  I don't like being outside.

00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,448
             Okay.

151
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,949
            I'm sure
   they told you at reception

152
00:06:57,951 --> 00:07:00,685
that we--we require appointments
           for tours.

153
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:03,488
   My supervisor gives us all
    a hard time about that.

        I'm Sam Sepiol.

155
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,693
     You should look me up.

             Okay.

158
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,883
                  Tell you what.

159
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:16,734
               Have your company
      call over to new accounts,

160
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,538
     and we can set something up
                later this week.

161
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,440
            Ask for Bill Harper.

162
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:22,441
  They'll know where to find me.

00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,776

   gives you a hard time now?

   of how big this place is.

department without a fire truck,

         without roads.

00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:46,017
I'll see you out.
You can go, Bill.

317
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,152
         Follow me to the lobby.

318
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,461
            (Romero)
     This woman's a ghost.

319
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,629
     None of these are her.

320
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:58,997
   No Facebook, no LinkedIn.

321
00:14:58,999 --> 00:15:00,565
       She's been married
         for 30 years.

322
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,300
         All we have is
her husband's cell phone number.

323
00:15:02,302 --> 00:15:03,301
      He doesn't even have
       a picture online.

324
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:05,003
      No hobbies, no kids,

325
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,672
      no credit problems,
      no weird sex stuff.

326
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,274

        I need to think.

00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:19,484
Yes, that's how they work
when you press the button.

330
00:15:20,654 --> 00:15:22,888
             Okay.

00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,123

    all just people, right?

332
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,524
    When it gets down to it,
      everyone's the same.

333
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,892
      They love something.

334
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,259
      They want something.
      They fear something.

335
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,626

      but specifics don't change

336
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,515
           the way that everyone
                  is vulnerable.

337
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,401
    It just changes the way that
we access those vulnerabilities.

I'm sorry.

341
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:02,994
   I need to go to my office.

342
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,663
  Reception will see you out.

344
00:16:15,575 --> 00:16:17,575
            (Mobley)
        I spoofed a text
       from her husband.

345
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,192
It's a palm print scanner.

346
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:37,328
          (Mr. Robot)
       Get out of there.

347
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,197
            (Romero)
        There's one door
        manually locked.

348
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,999
    It's a fire code thing,
  and I think you can pick it.

349
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,100
             Where?

350
00:16:42,102 --> 00:16:43,334
 It's at the end of the hallway

You're gonna have to double back
    and go through the door

     and make a run for it.

   - Okay, real important...
           - Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,127
Wingstravaganza means
wings and extravaganza.

367
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:45,463
          Do you know
    what extravaganza means?

368
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,731
Yep, it's a big deal.

369
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,067
         - You got it.
           - Mm-hmm.

370
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,702
       You look nervous.
        Are you excited?

371
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,638
          - Oh, yeah.
            - Okay.

372
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,573
    So you'll shadow me for
 the week, but don't sweat it.

373
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,076
           It's like
    every other server job.

374
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:00,278
Well, I've actually never
been a waitress before.

375
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,612
              Oh.

376
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,581
This is kind of like
a new beginning for me.

377
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,716
     What were you doing before?

378
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,618
Pharmaceutical sales.

Oh, um, just,

           Welcome to
 Steel Mountain's data center.

383
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,205
          Our facility
  meets diamond specifications

384
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:30,475
     and features a tier 10
  certified build and design,

385
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:33,611
   providing you with a safe,
      rock-solid fortress

386
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,313
      for your data needs.

387
00:18:35,315 --> 00:18:37,415
All of our facilities implement

388
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,816
         comprehensive
      security measures...

389
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:42,320
            (Tyrell)
   They say I'm overdoing it,
       and I say exactly.

390
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,622
            [laughs]
            So yeah.

391
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,424
            Elliot.

392
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,292
      - Nice meeting you.
           - You too.

393
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,629
  - Tell your wife I said hi.
           - I will.

394
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,664
           Those men
    I just shook hands with,

395
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:57,135
    financiers of Hezbollah
           and ISIS.

396
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:59,337
       I wouldn't stare.

397
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,372
            (Elliot)
          Did he know
      I was gonna be here?

398
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,907
   Does he know why I'm here?

399
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,276
   Shit, he's gonna kill me.

400
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,245
             As you were saying?

401
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,615
       Uh, just a routine
      data process check.

402
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:13,751
       Allsafe does them
         all the time.

403
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,853
                   But why would
                  they send you?

404
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,755
              That type of thing
           isn't usually handled

405
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,857
        by the engineers, is it?

406
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,294
  We've been overlapping a lot
         in our duties.

407
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:25,897
        Budget reasons.

408
00:19:25,899 --> 00:19:30,501
   It seems we both had the idea
         to work off-site today.

409
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,737
Let's call this fortuitous.

410
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,673
Join me for lunch?

411
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,709
            S-sure.

412
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,911
          I eat lunch.

00:19:39,913 --> 00:19:41,379

414
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,248
So you are like
the rest of us.

415
00:19:46,486 --> 00:19:47,618
Come.

417
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,824
We got to go.

418
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:54,859
   We're not going anywhere.

419
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,428
     This changes nothing.

420
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,363
What can I get you,
Elliot?

421
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,631
Have a lot of things here.

422
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,899

    He has a vulnerability.

423
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,502
    He's an arrogant prick,
     and he's proud of it.

424
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,637
    He cares what you think
           about him,

425
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,339
    even though he probably
      hates that he does.

426
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:11,242

         is his hubris,

427
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:13,778
    but it's also his flaw,
    and that's your exploit.

428
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,779
                  Would be nice.

429
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:16,847
You eat here?

431
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,821
            (Romero)
       Is that your plan,
        to piss him off?

432
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,723
                  No, wait, man.
                           Wait.

00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,914

  you came all the way out here.

439
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:53,784

00:31:44,937 --> 00:31:47,537
       which felt like a decade.

615
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:50,107
           [laughter]

616
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,912
Your place is beautiful.

617
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,580
             I wish I could take
                 the compliment.

618
00:31:56,582 --> 00:31:58,615
                  The decorating
              is Scott's domain.

619
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,384
         - Oh, really?
             - Yes.

620
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,653
          - Very nice.
            - Yeah.

621
00:32:02,655 --> 00:32:04,922
       Where's all the--
       the antiques from?

622
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,323
                       They're--

623
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:09,259
So they tapped you
for CTO, yes?

624
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,527
     They're 17th century.

625
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:13,263
Don't be surprised.

626
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,166
                   Suspicious is
                  more accurate.

627
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:20,337
       I was beginning to wonder
        why you set this dinner.

628
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,106
        Four people in the world

629
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,142
    know about my conversations.

630
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:29,413
Somehow you're number five.

631
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:33,984
                Then I'm exactly
  what you need in a right hand.

632
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:37,020
So that's what
this is about.

633
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,956
                Isn't everything
                about something?

634
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:41,458
Like, we were thinking about,
is it--is it babyproof?

635
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,294
              Ah, yeah, that's--
         that's a consideration.

636
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,530
If you were me,

637
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:50,267
would you trust you
as your right hand?

638
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,601
                  If I were you,

639
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:55,706
            I wouldn't have even
            let me in the house.

00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:14,291
              Hey.

644
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,592
Hey, it's me.

645
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,427
Is now a good time?

646
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,062
             Yeah.

647
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,564
I'm at my new job.

648

        How's it going?

649
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,601
[sighs]
Seriously, it's hard as hell,

650
00:33:24,603 --> 00:33:27,204
but I am getting
the hang of it.

651
00:33:27,206 --> 00:33:29,473
At first, it took me,
like, years to marry ketchups,

652
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:31,274
but it turns out I'm amazing

653
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:34,211
at upselling
expensive cocktails.

654
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,679
       I'm not surprised.

655
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,081
And then when I have
to put together to-go orders,

656
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,617
it's like bagging Molly,
so I'm, like, kind of an expert.

657
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,085
How are you?

658
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,022
           I'm good.

659
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:47,257
 Wow, I've never heard you say

660
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:49,626
  a sentence like that before,
             ever.

661
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:53,630
 I did what I had to do today.

662
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:56,299
Well,
if you're around tonight,

663
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:58,602
come over and tell me
about it, okay?

664
00:33:58,604 --> 00:34:01,204
I got to go.

665
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,539
           Okay, bye.

666
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,688

    how to drink your wine.

668
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:24,428
        I indulge in few things,

669
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,196

670
00:34:26,198 --> 00:34:29,433

  when I could drink for one.

671
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:32,235
         But even then
      I had cheap tastes.

672
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,404
             It's safe to smell,
                         though.

673
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,472
                   Put your nose
                       in there.

You know, to me,
it smells like every wine.

                      [chuckles]

677

          really think about it.

00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:02,866
Mmm, I do smell lemon.

            - Yeah?

Excuse me?

                   the question?

689
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:16,313
You're a guest
in our house.

690
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:17,681

694
00:35:24,973 --> 00:35:28,158
       I think I'll mistake what
you said as a joke in poor taste

695
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,694
               and excuse myself
                to the bathroom.

696
00:35:33,198 --> 00:35:35,632

             Nope.

     My father picked me up

793
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:30,086

 my sneakers were full of sand,

       the world shifting
     and the oceans moving

804

 brought that sand to that spot
         on the beach,

805
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:56,713
    and then I took it away.

00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,921
            Pussies.

236
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,556
     I bet they didn't even
 bother to read the data dumps.

237
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:54,192
              But you read them.

238
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:56,127
You know it took me eight years

239
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:59,631
to rebuild my career
after our case was dismissed?

240
00:14:59,633 --> 00:15:05,336
So, as much as I think
this company is evil incarnate--

241
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,572
and trust me, they are--

242
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,108
you know, it's not worth it.

243
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,181
      What would it take,

244
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:20,118
       hypothetically...

245
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,387
        What do we need
       to prove our case?

246
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:25,189
        Hypothetically,
    a reliable eye witness.

247
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,091
           You know,
if you miraculously find someone

248
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,593
     on the inside to flip.

249
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,595
     Someone who was there

250
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:35,633
   when the decision was made
to falsify chemical waste intel.

251
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,602
              So,

252
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,472
 unless you're Facebook friends
  with one of those assholes,

253
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:45,176
this hypothetical is just that.

254
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,314
         Let's move on.

255
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:52,083
     Where are you working
          these days?

256
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,618
     You have a boyfriend?

257
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,521
        How's your dad?

258
00:15:56,523 --> 00:16:00,191
      I work for a company
    that doesn't respect me,

259
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,994
          my boyfriend
    recently cheated on me,

260
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:07,398
         and my father
      is drowning in debt.

261
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:23,381
   - I'll see you next time.
            - Okay.

262
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:26,617
            (Tyrell)
       Fluorescent lights
         are hell, no?

263
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,455
Was there a change in schedule?

264
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:33,424
 I thought I had Spencer next.

265
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:37,161
       These interviews, they're
      just a waste of your time.

266
00:16:37,163 --> 00:16:41,299
 I mean, you know our regulatory
       and IP issues inside out.

267
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,267
   I was thinking we play hooky
            the rest of the day,

268
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,203
              hit the back nine.

269
00:16:49,074 --> 00:16:51,476
      Is that a Vacheron?

270
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,144
   Patek Philippe Tourbillon.

271
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:57,548
A gift from the Prince of, uh...

272
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,588
    Oh, does it even matter?

273
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:08,226
            [laughs]

274
00:17:08,228 --> 00:17:11,662
    But I'm not blowing off
    my remaining interviews.

275
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:14,499
             Look.

276
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:18,770
        I know you think
  you were a shoo-in for CTO,

277
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:21,606
       and you're pissed.

278
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:25,777
   Probably wishing I'd fall
    into the subway tracks.

279
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:30,548
          So how about
     you cut the bullshit?

280
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,651
    I'm afraid your paranoia has
    gotten the best of you, but,

281
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,653
 nevertheless, please excuse me.

282
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,221
           I'll leave
    you to review your notes

283
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:38,756
    before Spencer arrives.

284
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:43,628
 Oh, and thank you for dinner.

285
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,063
       The entire evening
        was enchanting.

286
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:48,266
      The food, the wine,
       the lovely Sharon.

287
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,171
    Please tell her I say hello.

288
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,808
    Did you enjoy the view?

289
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:05,550
       What, do you think
     she wouldn't tell me?

290
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,621
          I'm not sure
      what you're trying--

291
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:12,590
You want to watch me piss too?

292
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,325
I've had several glasses
of water.

293
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:16,227
        Scott, a misunderstand--

294
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,830
   Happy to pull my dick out
 for you, if that's your thing.

295
00:18:18,832 --> 00:18:20,298
  Watching the Knowles family
            urinate.

296
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,666
        [zipper pulled]

297
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:26,204
Hell, I could fly my brother
in from Miami.

298
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:28,573
He has the bladder
of a small child.

299
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:32,210
   You'd probably bust a nut
   watching him take a leak.

300
00:18:32,212 --> 00:18:34,312
 I'm not sure what she told you,
              but if I were you,

301
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,380
        I would tell her to find
           more appropriate ways

302
00:18:36,382 --> 00:18:39,550
    of managing her imagination.

303
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:41,385
            Tyrell.

304
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,854
      I want you to accept
         a hard truth,

305
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:46,724
     right here, right now,
        in front of me.

306
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:50,795
  You are not going to be CTO.

307
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:57,468
    I want to see that look
      wash over your face.

308
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,372
    It's the only way I know
   you'll stop playing these

309
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,474
      silly, silly games.

310
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,776
                 [laughs softly]

311
00:19:05,778 --> 00:19:09,847
            Oh, I am fully aware
              you're CTO, Scott.

312
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:14,886
                    I'm not sure
      what more I can offer you.

313
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:17,622
             Wait.

314
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:20,191
             Here.

315
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,227
          I feel bad.

316
00:19:23,229 --> 00:19:25,496
           After all,
  you got a child on the way.

317
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,664
     You need all the help
          you can get.

318
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,466
            In fact,

319
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,936
  this would probably pay off
   the rest of your mortgage.

320
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:37,208
 Aren't you still in that neat
 little two-bedroom in Chelsea?

321
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,713
             There.

322
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,586
        That's the look
       I was looking for.

323
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,595
       [zipper pulls up]
          [door shuts]

324
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:02,600
      (Elliot voice-over)
  I keep brute-force thinking,
     but it's not working.

325
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:03,968
          I need help.

326
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,309
         [door buzzing]

327
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,251
            (Angela)
     Elliot, you in there?

328
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:21,352
      (Elliot voice-over)
             Shit.

329
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:22,820
        Why is she here?

330
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,488
         [door buzzing]

331
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,623
            (Angela)
            Elliot!

332
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:28,259
         [door buzzes]

333
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:32,230
           Let me in.

334
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:36,000
     Elliot, you in there?

335
00:20:36,002 --> 00:20:37,768
     Little blonde bitty.

336
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,638
            (Angela)
    Elliot, hit the buzzer.

337
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
         [door buzzing]

338
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,774
    I know you're in there.

339
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,376
              Go.

340
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:47,411
      Shut her up, and get
   her the hell out of here.

341
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:50,648
            (Angela)
      Elliot. Buzzer. Now.

342
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,383
      What about Darlene?

343
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,952
              She stays with us.
      And we'll be watching you,

344
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:57,788
          so don't bother trying
   any dumb shit, you dumb shit.

345
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,291
         [door buzzing]

346
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,560
        [stirring music]

347
00:21:02,562 --> 00:21:04,729
F---!

348
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:11,836
              â™ª

349
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:20,278
               Do you understand
               why you're angry?

350
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,413
      'Cause you know I'm right.

351
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:37,521
         I tried looking for you
 after Gideon's the other night.

352
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,391
                 Where were you?

353
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:44,662
 I had to think about things,
           you know?

354
00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:48,999
        We always knew
      what Evil Corp did.

355
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,535
   We didn't have the proof,

356
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,939
          but we knew.

357
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,741
     We were right about it
           all along.

358
00:22:56,743 --> 00:23:00,478
   In fact, that news report
     wasn't a confirmation.

359
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,582
       It was a reminder
       of how angry I am.

360
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,524
      You remember Nayar,
    the lawyer on the case?

361
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:15,659
     I went to her, Elliot.

362
00:23:15,661 --> 00:23:16,994
  Listen, Angela, now's not--

363
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:21,966
        I have an idea
  that will change the world.

364
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:24,502
I know it sounds really stupid,

365
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:28,172
    but I know how to do it.

366
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,842
I think it could actually work.

367
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:34,779
        [stirring music]

368
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,947
  I can't tell you what it is,
           because--

369
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,117
      (Elliot voice-over)
    Evil Corp, Angela, Vera,
 his brother, Darlene, Shayla.

370
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,952
       This is too much.

371
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,855
     I should just tell her
    what she wants to hear.

372
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:46,891
            Angela,

373
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,860
        trust yourself.

374
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,029
    You'll do what's right.

375

              â™ª

376
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:03,507
      That's all I needed.

377
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,544
   How's Shayla, by the way?

378
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:09,780
                        She's...

379
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:13,083
           you know.

380
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:15,519
      Tell her I say hi.

381
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:23,594
              â™ª

382
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,199
        You have no time
          to pull off

383
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:29,834
         whatever it is
    you think you're doing.

384
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,602
    What are you doing here?
       How did you know?

385

   Makes me hate myself that
  I've already gotten used to

122
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:59,718
the idea of her not being here.

123
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,787
           In a year,
   I'll maybe think about her

124
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,555
     every once in a while.

125
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,892
Then she'll become an anecdote,
        a thing to say.

126
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:09,761
   "I knew a girl that died,"

127
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,965
    with the added bonus of,
   "She died because of me."

128
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:16,735
  Maybe I should hate myself.

129
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:19,004
    Here are the last two forms.

130
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,872
      (Elliot voice-over)
    She's getting rid of me,

131
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:22,974
  in case you're still trying
      to figure that out.

132
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:25,043
          - Once I...
     - Sign on the bottom.

133
00:07:29,715 --> 00:07:31,082
            Then I'll deliver it
                   to the court,

134
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:32,684
         and in two weeks' time,
                  you'll receive

135
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:35,220
             an official release
               from the mandate.

136
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:36,922
          That second form means
         that we've been sitting

137
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,223
        in this room for a year.

138
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,025
      (Elliot voice-over)
         Over 52 hours

139
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:42,461
       of Krista's voice
   bouncing around this room.

140
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:45,931
She thinks she's a wasted echo.
         Maybe she is.

141
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,933
     I wonder how much time
           I've spent

142
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,701
 not listening to her in here.

143
00:07:49,703 --> 00:07:50,969
  I'm worried about you, Elliot.

144
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,103
               I really want you
            to keep coming here.

145
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,939
       We've got a lot more work
                          to do.

146
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:55,240
      (Elliot voice-over)
     She wants more from me

147
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,075
 but she doesn't believe in me.

148
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,578
       I tried because I believe
         some part inside of you

149
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,880
         wants to do this right.

150
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,949
      (Elliot voice-over)
              You?

151
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,184
      Are you on her side?

152
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,709
 You should clean your sockets.

153
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:47,993
               .
     Sounds too good to be true,
                 What's the ask?

154
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,628
Given my client
has information

155
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:51,162
that could help
your client's case,

156
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:55,033
  we want the meeting restricted
      to her, Colby, and myself,

157
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,701
        and we want it conducted
                     off-record.

158
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,137
           [chuckles]
        Antara, come on.

159
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,873
          My client won't accept
                  your presence.

160
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,943
   Our client pays for ours.

161
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,611
          Then you're duty-bound
                  to present him

162
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,314
       with any legitimate offer
         of beneficial evidence.

163
00:09:09,316 --> 00:09:11,149
            [scoffs]
           Of course.

164
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:16,054
    Give us something truly
   legitimate and beneficial.

165
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,723
     You won't even tell us
 what the hell your client has.

166
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,726
Seth, we've been sitting
on opposite sides

167

        come out of the woodwork

169
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:27,666
            trying to scam Colby
                   for millions.

170
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,901
 I'm giving him the only glimmer
               of hope he's had.

171
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:36,041
  We'll pass along your offer.
     Thanks for your time.

to see me.

         Look, I appreciate your
         commitment to this job.

176
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,208
             But I don't see how
           you've plowed through

177
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:15,013
 these last few weeks, so I want
     to offer you some time off.

178
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,781
     - Just some time to--
    - I don't need time off.

00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,933
                I'm so sorry she
         was taken away, Elliot,

182
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:40,238
         but don't let her death
         close you off entirely.

     I got into web design

186
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,049
 by ripping off sites I liked.

187
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,852
     All you had to do was
  view source on your browser

188
00:10:53,854 --> 00:10:56,087
       and there it was,
           the code.

189
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:59,691
    You could copy-paste it,
      modify it a little,

190
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:05,697
      put your name on it,
and like that, it was your site.

              as the rest of us.

266
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,035
 You know something screwed up?

267
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:06,337
 I heard that, some assistants,
       they're going gay

268
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,006
     to move up the ladder.

269
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,440
         I'll do you one better.

No. Oh, my God!

273
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,684
  Hey, Dwight, I meant to ask.
     How are your children?

274
00:15:19,686 --> 00:15:22,086
Hell if I know.
Sent 'em off to Lawrence.

275
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,621
I think Julia likes art.

276
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,057
           Oh, well.
       Can't win 'em all.

277
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,392
                       Lawrence?

278
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:28,993
            You'll never be able

279
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,162
          to afford that tuition
                on unemployment.

280
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:34,032
            - Sorry?
        - You're fired!

00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,686
        You two as well.

284
00:15:54,688 --> 00:15:57,689
I'm making sure you all receive
the minimum severance packages.

285
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,694
Mr. Wellick,
I-I don't understand.

286
00:16:02,696 --> 00:16:04,462
What did we do?

287
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,707
            Nothing.

288
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:18,676
           - After--
- You said you would update me.

289
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,545
             I needed to discuss
                   our situation

290
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,747
      with the state's attorney.

291
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,049
   Thanks for coming in, Roy.

292
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:28,119
Yeah.

293
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:34,092
    I think you should have
            a seat.

294
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,165
Colby's lawyers called
30 minutes ago.

295
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,102
They wanted a promise of total
immunity before the meeting,

296
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:46,471
which I obtained from the man
you just met.

297
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:50,541
So, yes, Colby agreed...

298
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,012
with a caveat.

299
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:57,015
    I can't be in the room.
    You have to go in alone.

300
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:06,624
Look, you made a ballsy move...

301
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,093
but you doing what you're
about to do--

302
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:11,129
entering the home
of a very powerful man

303
00:17:11,131 --> 00:17:14,132
      with a lot at stake
 and asking him for something--

304
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:18,069
         that's always
    a dangerous proposition.

305
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:21,506
      So one last time...

306
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,541
     are you sure you want
          to do this?

       As heartbreaking as it is
                   to hear that,

314
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,167
               you're gonna have
                to put that off.

   - No, man, not this time.

317
00:17:52,138 --> 00:17:54,505
                        I'm out.

318
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:56,541
You can't be out.
We need you.

319
00:17:56,543 --> 00:17:59,510
      Look, man, I got a new set

           So, you know, I mean,
                      good luck,

322
00:18:03,116 --> 00:18:05,817

What is this?
What are you doing here?

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,221
             Well, I figured out
                   how to insert

                         Try it.

331
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,507
     The THC level is borderline
                  in that blend,

332
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:33,111
   and the lavender doesn't mess
                  with the high.

333
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,113
              You just smooth it
                   on your skin.

334
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,882
So you're rejecting a revolution
in favor of aroma profiles?

335
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,851
What a waste of potential.

336
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,220
         Look, man, I know I got
                   a good brain.

337
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,389
                      Besides...

338
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:48,759
     what was our little project
             in the end, anyway?

     Wasted shit, if you ask me.

340
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:54,699
  Well, now you're borderline
        pissing me off.

341
00:18:54,701 --> 00:18:58,870
                 Is that a fact?

342
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:00,838
                And what exactly
                are you gonna do

                    that border?

    Look at my face, Romero.

345

 You and I both know I'm crazy.

00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,282
   Not the cute kind either.

347
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:14,418
    I'm talking crazy crazy!

          [gun clicks]

349
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,358
        You lost touch.

350
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,792
     You forgot the feeling
       of spilling blood

     by winning the fight.

I didn't want to hurt you,
Romero.

353

I love you, man.

354
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,802
I just wanted you to come back
to the arcade with me

355
00:19:31,804 --> 00:19:35,306
so we could change the world
together.

356
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:39,677
I am clearly too crazy
for you to say no to.

357
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:40,778

361
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,958
You gave me your word when we
started this thing

362
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,660
that you'd finish it.

363
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,763
I gave you my word what I'd do
if you didn't.

364
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,565
  See you back at the arcade.

365
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:24,288
                           Good.
     I see the girl got you tea.

366
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,923
        Well, let's get started.

367
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,866
           How much do you want?

368
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,539
              Write your number.

369
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,975
         You can ask me anything
                       you want,

370
00:20:43,977 --> 00:20:46,477
              but I promise you,
          at the end of the day,

371
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,547
     money will always be better
   than what you're looking for.

372
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,387
Mr. Colby, did you attend

373
00:20:56,389 --> 00:20:59,924
the executive board meetings
during 1993?

374
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,597
Were you in the room
when the decision was made

375
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,666
to ignore the treatment
of hazardous waste

376
00:21:08,668 --> 00:21:10,668
in Washington Township?

377
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,444
I have information
which can help you...

378
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:24,982
if you answer my question.

379
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:29,287
               I don't know what
           you're talking about.

380
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,290
If you agree to testify
against the executives

381
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:36,794
who covered up the illegal
dumping of expoxy resin waste,

382
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,796
I will testify that I broke
chain of custody

383
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,532
with the dat file central
to your case.

384
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,705
                 [flutters lips]

385
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:48,873
                 You're that hot
                    little thing

386
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,675
               that came by here
                    a month ago.

387
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:54,512
          The girl from Allsafe.
                      [chuckles]

388
00:21:56,982 --> 00:22:00,418
I remember, yeah.

389
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:09,827
Okay...I'm gonna answer
your question.

390
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,763
But here's what I need
from you first.

391
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,900
So I'm gonna pull down
my pants,

392
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:19,003
and then I'm gonna need you to
take that pouty mouth of yours

393
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,672
and swallow up my balls.

394
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,942
Now, they're big and hairy,
especially the left one,

395
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,078
so you're really gonna
have to, I don't know,

396
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,614
squish 'em up to get 'em
inside there.

397
00:22:30,616 --> 00:22:32,950
You're probably gonna have
to do one cheek at a time.

398
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:37,755
But then, once they're all warm
and snug in there,

399
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:41,359
I want you to repeat
your question to me

400
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:44,595
as clearly as you can.

401
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:48,866
Then, and only then,
am I willing to answer.

402
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,873
What do you say?

403
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:17,695
               If you don't take
                    this deal...

404
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:21,599
          you'll become like me.

405
00:23:21,601 --> 00:23:26,504
         Sure, maybe you'll live
                in this house...

406
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,773
        maybe you'll have money,

407
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,941
                but even if your
    expensive lawyers find a way

408
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:35,780
     to get you off, people will
 still think that you're guilty.

409
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:41,886
                         [sighs]

                      [chuckles]

412
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:52,863
  The respect of people you know

413
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:58,836
     and the people you don't...

414
00:23:58,838 --> 00:24:03,841
          it's a shitty feeling.

415
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:06,677
                       Trust me.

416
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,894
            I'll have "the girl"
                     let me out.

417
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,038
            Flipper.
      Is she microchipped?

418
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,849
                Okay, very good.

419
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:46,784
              Housekeeping done.

420
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,853
     Now onto the real business.

421
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,989
               Has your dog ever
             eaten trash before?

422
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:56,060
              No.
  I mean, not that I remember.

423
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,795
                 Well, lucky for
              your bank account,

424
00:24:57,797 --> 00:25:00,030
       the piece is small enough
             to pass on its own.

425
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:02,066
          Unfortunately, though,
               it's large enough

426
00:25:02,068 --> 00:25:04,068
     to send her puking all over
                 your apartment.

427
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,905
            So I would crate her
 for a few days and monitor her.

428
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,040
She won't know what you're doing
                is good for her.

429
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,286
     [cell phone vibrates]

430
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,156
            (Antara)
   What the hell did you do?

431
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,893
        You were right.
  I was only trying to prove--

432
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:33,130
            (Antara)
  Colby's lawyers just called.
       He wants to talk.

433
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,933
        Get back there.

434
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,245
It's a little early in
the morning to be nerding out,

435
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:51,181
don't you think?

436
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,250
                       How long?

437
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,925
             - Hmm?
 - I knew if I asked you that--

438
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:04,128
                       How long?

439
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,098
Couple weeks.

440
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,969
    And you had the balls to ask
     for whiterose with my shit?

441
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,005
              It's like you want
          to get us both killed.

442
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:19,243
What happened?
He responded?

443
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:22,913
       You know, you didn't have
                 to make me look

444
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,582
     like a shitty foot soldier.

445
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:26,083
Nobody would ever even know--

446
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,252
          You got root on my box
               and found the IP,

447
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:32,056
   then you joined their channel
                 with my handle.

448
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:40,931
                        [scoffs]
                  We're so done.

449
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,866
                    I don't want
               to see you again.

450
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,642
   But you fools actually got
           your wish.

451
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:54,778
                        [scoffs]
               I don't know why,

452
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,647
               but the meeting's
           actually gonna be on.

453
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,649
     I'd tell you to be careful,
                      but I know

454
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,651
           that's the last thing
                you're gonna be.

455
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,942
  My- Does that mean that--er
     - Exactly what I said.

456
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:27,144
 I asked you back here to make
   sure that you can pull off

457
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:30,014
        your testimony,
      make sure that this

458
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,649
chain of custody story of yours
          is straight.

459
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,952
   I can't afford any trips.

460
00:27:34,954 --> 00:27:37,187
          I'm not going to trip.

461
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,960
So, what--

462
00:27:42,962 --> 00:27:44,428
what's in this for you, anyway?

463
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,398
I know you hate me.

464
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,034
So, what, you're gonna just
let me off scot-free?

465
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:53,971
What do you get out of this?

466
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:57,841
                        Earlier,
         I asked you a question.

467
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,978
          You never answered it.

468
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,350
If I'm agreeing to testify
in your case, then, yes,

469
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,986
you know,
I attended several meetings.

470
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:13,957
      Tell me about the one when
they decided to ignore the leak.

471
00:28:13,959 --> 00:28:16,293
I'm--I'm not sure
what you're asking.

472
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:20,064
       What was the meeting like
          when you decided this?

473
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,135
I get it.

474
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:28,105
You want to know, like,
what was it like?

475
00:28:28,107 --> 00:28:32,176
Like, um, did we all have cigars
and laugh hysterically

476
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,211
as we signed
the evil documents?

477
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,013
Is that what you pictured?

478
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:37,381
Well, I'm sorry, hon.

479
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,050
See, the world doesn't work
like that.

480
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:44,254
                        Tell me.
           Tell me how it works.

481
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:50,961
Uh, Jesus, um...all right,
all right.

482
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:56,033
Let's see.
January, '93.

483
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,902
Well, my secretary then
was Elaine.

484
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,271
So Elaine brought us a platter
of shrimp cocktail

485
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:05,375
to tide us to dinner,
which pissed us off

486
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:08,979
because we just had a platter
at the holiday party.

487
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,247
Jim opened the bar.

488
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,916
Now Jim was a real piece
of work.

489
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,985
I mean, half pansy,
half mafia.

490
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:18,489
First sign of a tight decision,
he'd be chain smoking

491
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:21,391
down a river of scotch.

492
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:24,928
Uh...

493
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,530
you know, it rained.

494
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,533
It rained.
I remember that, yeah.

495
00:29:33,538 --> 00:29:35,939
                           So...

496
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:41,779
                 you were drunk,
          eating shrimp cockail,

497
00:29:41,781 --> 00:29:45,315
     and it was raining when you
    decided my mother would die?

498
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,393
                     That's why.

499
00:29:56,395 --> 00:30:00,197
   So people like you won't keep
      sitting in rooms together.

500
00:30:07,906 --> 00:30:12,543
     Did any of it ever give you
                 or anyone pause

501
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:15,312
  when you made those decisions?

502
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:21,084
Yeah.

503
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:23,287
Yeah, sure.

504
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,394
But, um...

505
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:34,998
then you go home, and, uh,
and you have dinner,

506
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,503
you know, and--and you wake up
the next morning.

507
00:30:47,078 --> 00:30:51,081
    Here's to a man who has
a bright future at our company,

508
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,317
      a man you all know,

509
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:57,020
  a man who is going to change
   this company for the good,

510
00:30:57,022 --> 00:31:01,992
     a man smart enough to marry
  a woman every bit his equal...

511
00:31:01,994 --> 00:31:03,894
          [chuckling]

512
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:08,866
        Our new Chief Technology
         Officer, Scott Knowles.

513
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,467
           [applause]
       (man) Here, here!

514
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,169
           Thank you.
           Thank you.

515
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:13,503
     - Thank you, Phillip.
           - Welcome.

516
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:15,138
     - Thank you very much.
         - Here we go.

517
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,907
     It's great to be here.
         And we're off.

518
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:18,408
       - Thanks, Phillip.
     - You're very welcome.

519
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,944
  - Congratulations, darling.
    - Thank you, thank you.

520
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:23,247
 - I'll leave you to it, okay?
     - Don't break a sweat.

521
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:25,449
  - Oh, here, come, say hello.
    - Hey, Joe, how are you?

522
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,421
[speaking Swedish]

523
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:36,560
      [indistinct chatter]

524
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,572
                        (Sharon)
                      Thank you.

525
00:31:53,544 --> 00:31:56,046
        Tyrell, nice to see you.

526
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:57,314
Is it?

527
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,483
I hear you shared our moment
with your husband.

528
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:01,418
            [laughs]
          Oh, come on.

529
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,120
   That was over a month ago.

530
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,123
         Don't tell me
       you're still sore.

531
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:09,026
   Hmm, I sense some defeat.

532
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:21,371
      Well, I considered myself,
 at the very least, reprimanded.

533
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:23,106
How disappointing.

534
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,943
One tiny curveball
and you gave up.

535
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:27,077
(man)
Miss.

536
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,979
Thank you.

537
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:30,580
Should have known
that you were nothing more

538
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,116
than a bold entrance.

539
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:35,652
  Are you saying you don't crave
                 a bold entrance

540
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:40,123
                     every time,
       over and over, sustained?

541
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,392
                Meet me tonight.

542
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,094
I'm a little busy.

543
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:45,295
          Come to my office now.

544
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,164
Are you really asking me that?

545
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,100
      I don't recall phrasing it
              as a question, no.

546
00:32:50,102 --> 00:32:53,270
Fine, then I just
won't show up.

547
00:32:53,272 --> 00:32:55,305
                  Then the roof.

548
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:57,975
        Take the back stairwell.

549
00:32:57,977 --> 00:33:00,110
       The cameras have been out
                    since March.

550
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:03,246
               No one will know.

551
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,087
             Well, you just made
              a long day longer.

552
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:11,722
I know that Allsafe will have
to fire me,

553
00:33:11,724 --> 00:33:13,557
but testifying was
the right thing to do.

554
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:16,226
        I have worked my ass off
             to take care of you

555
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:18,028
             and of every person
                in this company.

556
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,163
                     Do you know
                what that means?

557
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,366
You've been a great boss,
Gideon--

558
00:33:22,368 --> 00:33:25,168
       See, once this confession
                    goes public,

559
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,170
                no one will want
         to do business with us.

560
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,739
      The company will go under.

561
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:30,207
I couldn't let Colby
take the fall

562
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:32,175
  - for something that I did.
         - Oh, come on!

563
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,643
    You and I both know you
 didn't break chain of custody.

564
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,445
  I did and I feel terrible--

565
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:39,783
        Angela! Please!
          Stop lying.

566
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:48,558
         You do this...
   all these people go down,

567
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,661
       all their families
           that rely

568
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:55,232
 on what this company provides
           for them.

569
00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:21,258
So this is where
the rabbit hole leads?

570
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,426
Got to be honest,

571
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:25,462
I half-expected you
not to show up.

572
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:29,399
    And I half-expected you
      to be a tattletale.

573
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,301
[laughs]
So you are sore.

574
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:33,804
Oh, come on.
You intrigued me.

575
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:36,406
I intrigued back.

576
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,209
        Can't we just be
     more straightforward?

577
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:42,746
       Oh, that's no fun,
       but if you insist,

578
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,314
   I just came up here to see
       if you were really

579
00:34:44,316 --> 00:34:47,417
    as gullible as you seem.

580
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:50,120
My husband's downstairs
getting the job that you want,

581
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:52,122
and you're up here
trying to f--- me.

582
00:34:52,124 --> 00:34:54,391
Now whether that's you
being straightforward

583
00:34:54,393 --> 00:34:56,626
or a game, either way,

584
00:34:56,628 --> 00:34:59,196
it's played pretty poorly,
if you ask me.

585
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:02,132
              Hmm.
  Again, I asked no question.

586
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,167
       All I can tell you
        is you need this

587
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,336

 the indulgence to your sister

Unfortunately,
this admission

the hackers are still

189
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:53,344
 the honeypot will ensure that
  they can't cause any damage.

00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:54,979
They'll log into the decoy

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,343
      You weren't around.

282
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,878
               Yeah.

283
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,381
             Kinda had
           a rough month.

284
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,451
           I'm sorry.

285
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:44,155
          Tell me what happened.

286
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,890
    We were being pressured.

287
00:18:45,892 --> 00:18:47,558
            By who?

288
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,861
Some guy.

289
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:53,197
He gave Ollie a CD
that infected his laptop,

290
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:57,435
stole his pictures, his emails,
and browser cache.

291
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,837
He said to install
the disk at Allsafe,

292
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,373
or he would leak
everything online.

293
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,908
It was a while ago.

294
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,244
I thought
he forgot about us.

295
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,345
      (Elliot voice-over)
          I was right.

296
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,880
  The hack was a distraction.

297
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:11,916
       This is about me.
      This is the meeting.

298
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,486
        You should have
          come to me.

299
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,321
I told you,

300
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:18,523
you weren't there.

301
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:21,259
You're never there anymore.

302
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,795
Something is going on
with you, Elliot.

303
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,631
You have not been the same
the past couple of months,

304
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:28,499
and this happened
before Shayla.

305
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,901
                   You're wrong.

306
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,536
You're lying!

307
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,372
You don't talk to me
anymore!

308
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,240
Just tell me
what to do here!

309
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,875
Because the only solution
I can think of

310
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:39,610
is to give up.

311
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,521
God, say something!

312
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,494
                   You're right.

313
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:59,597
          We don't talk anymore.

314
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,642
It's so strange.

315
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:14,445
I really miss us.

316
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,883
            Why is that strange?

317
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,389
Because I never thought
I'd have to.

318
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,527
      (Elliot voice-over)
            Hackers.

319
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,230
  We inherently trust no one,

320
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:33,998
     including each other.

321
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,967
       I'll never be able
          to tell her.

322
00:20:35,969 --> 00:20:38,236
      There will always be
          this divide,

323
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:41,305
          my wall that
      she can't look over.

324
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,977
       And she knows it.

325
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:56,354
      (ElThe Dark Armyer)
 has taken extraordinary steps

326
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,490
  to make sure this meeting's
   exactly how they want it.

327
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:03,261
    Is that why the infamous
  whiterose is such a legend?

328
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:07,331
   Because he's more paranoid
      than the rest of us?

329
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:19,310
     I'm Elliot. Alderson.

330
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,889
          [dark music]

331
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:39,964
              â™ª

332
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,868
      (Elliot voice-over)
        A Faraday cage.

333
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,936
  A room specifically designed

334
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,472
   to prevent electromagnetic
         interference.

335
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:53,944
      No radio, no signal,
   no WiFi, nothing to hack.

336
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:00,051
I think I'm here
to see you.

337
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,060
                  Am I supposed
                  to follow you?

338
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:15,399
       Are you just going
         to stand there

339
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,902
         or do you want
    to hand me those drives?

340
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,938
Mm-mm-mm.

341
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,939
             [beep]

342
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:23,908
This meeting has started.

343
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:26,911
I manage my time
very carefully, Mr. Alderson.

344
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,579
Each beep indicates
one minute of my time

345
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:30,081
that has passed.

346
00:22:30,083 --> 00:22:32,616
I have allotted you
no more than three minutes.

347
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,023
                  Are you really
                  gonna do that?

348
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,392
I suggest you pick
better topics of conversation.

349
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:44,095
I have 17 more items
on my agenda today.

350
00:22:44,097 --> 00:22:45,529
             The Evil Corp hack,

351
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:47,365
            we should go through
              with it this time.

352
00:22:47,367 --> 00:22:49,533
You are turning out to be
a grave disappointment.

353
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,535
                  We were ready.
    We had everything set to go.

354
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:53,904
Dwelling is
so inefficient.

355
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:55,873
             Hey, you pulled out
                      last time.

356
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,408
Wasting more time,

357
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,043
telling me things
I already know.

358
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,545
       - [clicks tongue]
      - But we were ready.

359
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:04,415
     That is the third time
 that you have expressed that.

360
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,449
      (Elliot voice-over)
       She's trolling me.

361
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,017
             [beep]

362
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:09,086
You have not advanced
this conversation.

363
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,888
Do you intend to?

364
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,156
               Since last month,

365
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:14,058
             Evil Corp has moved
             its tapes to five--

366
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,459
Backup facilities,

367
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:17,628
and you have a plan
to take them all down.

368
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,929
                            Yes.

369
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:21,432
Finally, you have
communicated something.

370
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,000
                So are you ready
              to do this or not?

371
00:23:23,002 --> 00:23:25,603
You are the one
who is not ready.

372
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:28,472
It was you
who failed all along.

373
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:30,408
What you've lacked
was focus.

374
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,843
You strayed from the hack
to target Terry Colby.

375
00:23:32,845 --> 00:23:35,012
This opened
a vulnerability.

376
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:36,147
Suspicion.

377
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:40,818
Specifically by
Gideon Goddard.

378
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,053
           That's why
      you hacked Allsafe.

379
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,189
To monitor his activities.

380
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,924
                 And that's when
                   we discovered

381
00:23:46,926 --> 00:23:50,861
    that he turned your infected
         server into a honeypot.

382
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:52,763
             [beep]

383
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,533
Oh, 60 seconds and this
meeting will be over.

384
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,801
                           Wait.

385
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,803
The concept of waiting
bewilders me.

386
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,538
There are always deadlines.

387
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,440
There are always
ticking clocks.

388
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:04,975
That's why you must
manage your time.

389
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,610
                 I'll find a way
         to remove the honeypot.

390
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,145
Until 16 seconds ago,

391
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:10,047
you were not aware
there was a honeypot.

392
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,483
                   This does not
             inspire confidence.

393
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,084
            - Wait.
   - There's that word again.

394
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,986
          We'll take care of it.

395
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,922
 You know you could have told us
   about the honeypot weeks ago.

396
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,224
Every hacker
has her fixation.

397
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,993
You hack people,
I hack time.

398
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:25,596
So you should know that
when I set a time line,

399
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,231
there's a reason.

400
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:30,234
               You have 50 hours
                 and 23 minutes.

401
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:32,937
                  At that point,
     when all parties are ready,

402
00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,972
                we will initiate
                       the hack.

403
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:37,508
          We'll do it.

404
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,244
               Maybe next time--

405
00:24:40,246 --> 00:24:42,813
Understand something,
Mr. Alderson.

406
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,114
                  After I leave,

407
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:46,150
                  you will never
                   see me again.

408
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,819
There are very few people
in my life

409
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,221
that I have enough time
to see more than once,

410
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:52,756
                 and you are not
                    one of them.

411
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,897
                       Trust me,

412
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:03,767
                      that's not
                going to matter.

413
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,004
       Why are you doing
          all of this?

414
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,807
                       The hack?

415
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,275
      Why are you working
            with us?

416
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:12,910
             [beep]

417
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:25,823
      (Elliot voice-over)
 50 hours and 20 minutes left.

418
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,191
   I need to figure this out.

419
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:29,126
   Gideon's been spying on me
        the whole time.

420
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,995
 Honeypot service order, shit.

421
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,229
      I gotta do that now.

422
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,899
        Security token.
        Gideon's phone.

423
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:36,534
       I need his phone.

424
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,736
 50 hours and 19 minutes left.

425
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:41,839
     Damn, she infected me
    with her time paranoia.

426
00:25:41,841 --> 00:25:43,908
        We're all living
   in each other's paranoia.

427
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:46,710
         You definitely
       can't argue that.

428
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,979
      Is that why everyone
   tries to avoid each other?

429
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:50,281
      I need to calm down.

430
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:52,249
       I wish I could be
     an observer like you.

431
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:54,285
       Then I could think

     It's a pathetic fable,

464

and you, Allsafe, are a defender
    of this pitiful avarice.

     It will only take a moment.

581
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:05,836
           And you both did know
   the deceased, Sharon Knowles.

582

You did know her, yes?

583

Sharon Knowles?

584
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,111
That's terrible.

590

     Coffee would be great.

591

what time did you last see

594
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:49,880
Sharon Knowles last night?

595
00:35:49,882 --> 00:35:52,749
                    Mr. Wellick?

596
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,752
                   Are you okay?

600
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,729
   I think the baby's coming.

601
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,698
        We gotta get her
        to the hospital.

602

              [speaking Swedish]

603
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,356
How'd it go with
the climate control hack?

604
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:34,891
                        Handled.

605
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:37,360
     I happen to be really smart
             and good at things.

606
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,563
                        Not like
                you give a shit.

607
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,310
We should celebrate then.

608
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:06,389
In 43 hours, exactly,

609
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:10,594
our server will no longer
be a honeypot.

610
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,296
And that rootkit you wrote

611
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:16,900
will take down Evil Corp.

612
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:19,002
We did it, Darlene.

613
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:22,005
It's gonna happen.

614
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,910

619
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:45,495
                   You did this.

620
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,264
                     You did it.

621
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:48,531
         Just like that, Elliot,

622
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:52,569
  you're gonna change the world.

623
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,271
We did this.

624
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:58,341
            I would love to take
             credit on this one.

625
00:37:58,343 --> 00:38:00,910
                    But I can't.

626
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,446
       No, really, this was you.

627
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:10,020
               You are seriously
         the best person I know,

628
00:38:10,022 --> 00:38:12,322
                  you know that?

629
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,895
             I love you so much.

630
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,870

                  What the f---?

                 I'm--I'm sorry.

632
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:32,475
What the hell
is wrong with you?

633
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:33,843
           I'm sorry.

634
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,545
     I'm sorry, I thought--

635
00:38:35,547 --> 00:38:37,314
            I just--

636
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:40,016
I'm sorry.

637
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,485
      Oh, my God, Elliot.

638
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,922
     Did you forget again?

639
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:48,958
    Did you forget who I am?

640
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,797
       What do you mean?

641
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:55,398
          Forget what?

642
00:38:57,401 --> 00:39:01,504
 Elliot, I need you to tell me
      who you think I am.

643
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,507
  What are you talking about?

644
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,910
       Tell me right now.

645
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,516
      What are you saying?

646
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,720
            Elliot.

647
00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:23,493
      Of course I didn't--
         didn't forget.

648
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:26,429
        You're Darlene.

649
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:34,471
You're Darlene.

00:39:34,473 --> 00:39:36,473

00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,677
        You're Darlene.

652
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,417
      (Elliot voice-over)
            I know.

653
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,985
       I know what she's
         going to say.

654
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:49,986
          I'm your...

            Sister.

656
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:58,995

00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,952
      (Elliot voice-over)
      Darlene and I'd hide
   in movie theaters all day.

658
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,554
       Darlene would sing
          <i>Frere Jacques.</i>

659
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,122
      She rode her scooter
     in front of our house.

660
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,791
           I'm crazy.
       I'm crazy--crazy.

661
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:29,426
     She tried to run away
      in the third grade.

662
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,960
       How come I didn't
         remember this?

663
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:33,029
   Slept in the same bed when
    our mom was mean to us.

664
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,831
       Why did I forget?
     I remember her voice.

665
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,533
      How could I forget?
           I'm crazy.

673
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,549
         How can I just
     forget her like that?

674
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,517
        A whole person.
        A relationship.

675
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:55,819
        Is this amnesia?

676
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:56,886
           What else
     am I not remembering?

677

           I'm crazy.

          on the meds.

       never created you.

           to Krista.

- Mr. Robot.

37

Um, well,
I'd recommend the Pentium 90.

38
00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:35,160
They're lighting fast, and we've
got some in stock now.

39

With an 800 megabyte hard drive,
you'll be all set.

40

Or we could save you
a few bucks

41

42
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,802
Once we swap out
that motherboard

43
00:01:43,804 --> 00:01:47,172

you'll be better than new.

44

I pulled out my wallet,

I had three 20s.

on the counter.

Ugh.
I don't have time for this.

Is that what the last
three months have been?

us doing something important,

- You're right, I don't.

to know, Elliot,

- When we first
started fsociety.

you popped in over at my home.

So I got to be honest,
I was impressed by you.

[door closes]
- Sure, your career's finished,

628
00:39:01,406 --> 00:39:03,573
but you played a great
short game.

629
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:06,076
You took a big gamble,
and you got what you wanted.

630
00:39:06,078 --> 00:39:09,546
It was just, you know,
the wrong thing to want.

631
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,588
- What do you care?

632
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,524
- You know, I looked
into you over there at Allsafe.

633
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,059
[laughs]
I mean, lots of people

634
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,928
would've settled
into middle management bliss

635
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,429
after all the shit you've taken,

636
00:39:26,431 --> 00:39:27,964
but you didn't.

637
00:39:27,966 --> 00:39:29,666
You're relentless and smart,
and that combination

638
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:33,570
is very valuable to a lot
of important people,

639
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:35,972
people I know.

640
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:39,576
- Where are you going
with all of this?

641
00:39:39,578 --> 00:39:44,080
- I think I can land you
a pretty lucrative gig.

642
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,720
- A gig?
Where?

643
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,857
- Your favorite place,
where else?

644
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:00,997
- You slummed it all the
way down to Jersey in person

645
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:05,435
to offer me a job at the company
I'm currently suing?

646
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:07,604
What's the real ask here?

647
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,706
- I think you'd make
a great business woman.

648
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:12,675
I'm afraid
it's nothing more than that.

649
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:14,110
- Is this a joke?
-<i> It's no joke.</i>

650
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16,079
My pals think you
can bring a lot to the table.

651
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,448
- You can't be
offering me a job there.

652

<i>You're testifying against them.</i>

653
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:22,152
- So, you'll find
this out fairly soon,

654
00:40:22,154 --> 00:40:25,488
but in business, grudges
aren't really a thing.

655
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:26,823
It's too emotional.

656
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,558
<i>It's because you pulled off</i>

657
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,460
<i>what you pulled off</i>
<i>that they called me.</i>

658
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:33,530
- This is a huge
class action lawsuit.

659
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:35,565
They are going to pay millions.

-<i> Roughly 75</i>
<i>to 100 million.</i>

661
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,537
I mean, that's what
their lawyers will settle for

662
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,739
after they exhaust most
of your legal team's funds

663
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,808
for the next seven years.

664
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,609
<i>And sure, that is--</i>
<i>that's a lot of money,</i>

665
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,711
<i>but not to them, not really.</i>

666
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,480
We started a rainy-day fund

just for this occasion.

668
00:40:52,884 --> 00:40:56,019
The fund itself has already
made five times that amount.

669

- I'd like
to ask you to leave.

670
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:08,131
- Shall I pass your name
along then?

671
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,999
- I'm not working there.

672
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,701
They killed my mother.

679
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,217
so personally?

680
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,852
- Maybe I will.

681
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:30,553
Maybe someone has to.

If you want to change things,

684

perhaps you should try
from within,

685
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:43,500

Are you just filling them
and dumping them?

693
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:27,110
Where are your new 'scrips?

694
00:42:27,112 --> 00:42:29,879
- What does it matter?

695
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:35,552
I don't even know
what's real any more.

696
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:38,588
- Look, I know
you feel shitty right now,

697
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,956
but once you take your meds--

698
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:43,192
- Maybe we should
stop it, Darlene.

700
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,263

701
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:48,932
The hack.
Everything.

702
00:42:48,934 --> 00:42:51,134
Maybe we shouldn't execute it.

Why?

we're set.
- It wasn't me.

The whole time, it wasn't really
me doing all of that.

Maybe you don't realize this,

You came up with this.

00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:26,803
There is a part of you.

729
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,069
now, I don't know
what your grand plan is,

730
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,371
but I need to,
and you're going to tell me.

731
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:25,254
Two days ago I strangled a woman
to death just with my hands.

732
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:28,324
That's a strange sensation.

733
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,897
Something so tremendous done

734
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,967
by something so simple.

735
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:45,775
The first ten seconds
were...uncomfortable,

736
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:48,277
a feeling of limbo,

737
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,079
but then your muscles tense,

738
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,816
and she struggles and fights,

739
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:55,818
but it almost disappears in the
background

740
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:00,356
along with everything else
in the world.

741
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:06,095
At that moment it's just you
and absolute power,

742
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:11,033
nothing else.

743
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:13,436
That moment stayed with me.

744
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:22,411
I thought I'd feel guilty
for being a murderer,

745
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:27,150
but...I don't.

746
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:29,485
I feel wonder.

747
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:38,795

749
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:55,144
How long has this been going on?

750
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,079
- I don't know.

751
00:47:03,388 --> 00:47:06,189
- And what is it
that you're doing exactly?

752
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:10,159
<i>- Encrypting all the files.</i>

753
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,328
All of Evil Corp's
financial records

754
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,031
will be impossible to access.

755
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,566
The encryption key will
self-delete

756
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:18,601
after the process completes.

757
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:19,902
- What about the backups?

758
00:47:19,904 --> 00:47:21,904
- I took care
of that too.

759
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:24,440
Chainang.
- Steel Mountain.

760
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:26,843
Of course,
even when we went redundant.

761
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:29,278
- I hacked the
Air Dream network.

762
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,848
I was in all of them.

763
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:35,852
- You really
thought of everything.

764
00:47:35,854 --> 00:47:40,256
Who else was involved?

765
00:47:40,258 --> 00:47:42,458
- Just me.

766
00:47:45,330 --> 00:47:48,898
- Well, now it's you and me.

767
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,101
I've always told you we'd end up
working together, Elliot.

768
00:47:55,206 --> 00:48:00,243
But still, I have to know.

769
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:02,979
Why did you do it?

770
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:09,318
What did you hope to accomplish
by doing all of this?

771
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:16,492
- I don't know.

772
00:48:24,202 --> 00:48:26,903
I wanted to save the world.

will you go? Coyour current wife

00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:19,718
            - Done.
     - And one more thing.

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,755
        I'm gonna need something
                       from you.

9
00:00:22,757 --> 00:00:25,758
I don't just hack you, Krista,
I hack everyone.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,161
     <i>- So I gotta be honest,</i>
     <i>I was impressed by you.</i>

11
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:34,366
          I think I can land you
         a pretty lucrative gig.

12
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,069
         - Who are you?

13
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,537
           - That'll come later.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,807
           <i>Elliot, listen to me.</i>
         <i>I will never leave you.</i>

15
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:43,475
                    I will never
          leave you alone again.

16
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,678
       - Who are you talking to?

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,516
   - Since last month, Evil Corp
   has moved its tapes to five--

18
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,818
- Five backup facilities
and you have a plan

19
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,153
to take them all down.

20
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,487
 - Why are you working with us?

21
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,323
           [beeping]

22
00:00:58,325 --> 00:01:01,160
      <i>The hack, everything,</i>
  <i>maybe we shouldn't execute it.</i>

23
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:03,062
                          - Why?

24
00:01:03,064 --> 00:01:05,431
  The minute our infected server
  gets back on the main network,

25
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,598
                      <i>we're set.</i>

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,734
   <i>- Scott will continue here,</i>

27
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,336
  but you, I'm afraid, cannot.

28
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,176
       - What the hell are you--

29
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:18,544
             - Shh.

30
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:20,145
               I don't know what
             your grand plan is,

31
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:21,580
                  but I need to,
    and you're going to tell me.

32
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,852
              Why did you do it?

33
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,721
 What did you hope to accomplish
           by doing all of this?

34
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:33,125
 - I wanted to save the world.

35
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,511
             - Hey.

36
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,680
It's so good to see you.

37
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:05,858
You look great.
Can I get you a drink?

38
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,696
      - Look, Michael, I don't--

39
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,898
             Jesus.

40
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,234
           I forgot.

41
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,569
 It's not even your real name.

42
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,741
      - It's, uh...Lenny.

43
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,347
            - Lenny.

44
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:31,150
  So tell me what's going on.

45
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:34,253
      How advanced is it?

46
00:02:34,255 --> 00:02:37,156
  I already emailed my friend
      at Sloan Kettering.

47
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,490
       If it's as serious
         as you say...

48
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,893
       - Krista. Krista.
     - Then she wants to--

49
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,327
- Look.

50
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,699
         I'm not dying.

51
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,205
 - You're a sick motherf---er!

52
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:54,773
- Look, hold on. It's the only
way I could get you to meet up.

53
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,441
        - Don't you ever
         call me again,

54
00:02:56,443 --> 00:02:57,609
    even when you are dying.

55
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,578
- One of your patients
hacked me.

56
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,547
Some kid.

57
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,483
His name's Elliot Alderson.

58
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,252
I went to the police already.

59
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:10,322
Please sit back down.

60
00:03:10,324 --> 00:03:12,291
We need to talk about this.

61
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,271
      Here. The police had
   their cyber crime division

62
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:27,773
         look into it.

63
00:03:27,775 --> 00:03:32,211
They've been trying to track him
  down for the past six weeks.

64
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:36,348
    <i>- That proves it was him.</i>
    <i>He took my dog to the vet.</i>

65
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,384
             Look.
   See, she was microchipped,

66
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,854
   and I gave her chip number
  to all the vets in the city.

67
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:49,361
   This sick f---er not only
 hacked me and ruined my life,

68
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,263
 he stole my dog on top of it.

69
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,267
    This guy's certifiable.

70
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,403
    I mean, he's seeing you,
     so technically he is.

71
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,507
- What did he do to you exactly?

72
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:06,612
        - He made me...

73
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:09,615
          you know...

74
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:11,850
  say all those things to you.

75
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,258
 This kid should not be allowed
       to do what he did.

76
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,394
He hacked into my private life.

77
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:25,030
   <i>And then that Ashley Madison</i>
          <i>leak happened.</i>

78
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:28,533
        <i>My wife found out</i>
     <i>about everything anyway.</i>

79
00:04:28,535 --> 00:04:31,036
      <i>After the whole thing,</i>
           <i>she left me.</i>

80
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,505
        I can't even see
        my little girl.

81
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:35,607
The divorce is--
is a nightmare.

82
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,376
     - I don't give a shit
      about your divorce.

83
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,944
   - Look, if he's doing this
             to me,

84
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:42,047
   then he must be doing this
        to other people.

85
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:43,649
        Think about it.

86
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,652
    <i>If he knew enough about me</i>
           <i>to hack me,</i>

87
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:49,888
   <i>then that means he must have</i>
         <i>hacked you, too.</i>

88
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:54,860
       He did, didn't he?

89
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:06,638
   - I can't talk about this
           with you.

90
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,009
- Hey!
You have to help me catch him.

91
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,811
The dog thing alone
isn't enough.

92
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:16,048
My buddy says this
Computer Abuse and Fraud Act

93
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,749
is tough to prosecute.

94
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:20,085
You need a lot of evidence.

95
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:22,387
This kid is good, Krista.

96
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,824
He was routing through something
called proxies or something

97
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,858
out in Estonia.

98
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,360
He's untraceable.

99
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,462
Short of that whole country
falling apart,

100
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:33,065
we're never gonna get our hands
on any real evidence.

101
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:36,702
      - Just what exactly
     do you think I can do?

102
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:40,806
   - Maybe he said something.

103
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,475
You know, in your sessions.

104
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,545
Oh, come on, don't give me that
privileged information bullshit.

105
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,814
This guy's committing
a crime, a serious one.

106
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,383
He deserves to go to jail.

107
00:05:51,385 --> 00:05:53,919
If you know something,

108
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:56,621
if he said anything,
you have to tell me.

109
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,927
 Look, I'm not the enemy here.

110
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:05,063
             He is.

111
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:07,733
     We were a good thing.

112
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,668
           Remember?

113
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:13,004
   I mean, don't you remember
          this place?

114
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,943
  We had some good times here.

00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,718
- I hope you don't mind I came.

410
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,295
Something wrong?

411
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:58,536
- It's good to see you, Gideon.

412
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:00,571
- You too.

413
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:03,641
I know we didn't leave things
on the best of terms.

414
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:09,547
- Is it true?
What I heard about Allsafe?

415
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,517
- Well, there is no Allsafe.

416
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,520
I've had to furlough everyone.

417
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:19,089
I'm hoping to get up
and running again,

418
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:22,193
but everyone's telling me
it's over.

419
00:24:22,195 --> 00:24:24,695
- Gee, I wonder whose fault
that is.

420
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26,363
Was that you or me?

421
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,733
I'm getting all mixed up.
I can't recall.

422
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,503
- Let me get to my point.

423
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,439
The FBI believes that
I was behind the hack

424
00:24:35,441 --> 00:24:38,742
or complicit in some way.

425
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,711
I've given them
all the evidence I can.

426
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:43,547
I've cooperated
every step of the way,

427
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,083
but they still
keep coming at me.

428
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:49,253
They don't trust me.

429
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:51,822
In fact, I think they might be
hacking my email.

430
00:24:51,824 --> 00:24:53,791
I know someone is.

431
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:58,429
- And now you're wondering who
that someone is, aren't you?

432
00:24:58,431 --> 00:25:01,732
- There are logins from times
and machines I don't recognize.

433
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:05,402
- Because if it was me,
then that means it was you.

434
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:07,137
How about it, huh?

435
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:09,974
Could you live with yourself
knowing that you framed Gideon?

436
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:11,509
- I keep changing the password,

437
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:14,278
but it still hap...
- [groans]

438
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,746
- Elliot?

439
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:21,785
What's wrong?
- Go ahead, tell him.

440
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,655
Tell him that you're slowly
descending into madness.

441
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,657
- Stop.
- What? Stop what?

442
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:27,691
- There are only so many times

443
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,026
before my bullets finally

444
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,961
penetrate
that thick skull of yours,

445
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,963
and as the blood trickles out,

446
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,666
so goes any sense of reason.

447
00:25:35,668 --> 00:25:37,134
Round and round we go,

448
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:40,271
you not knowing
what you did or didn't do,

449
00:25:40,273 --> 00:25:43,407
our infinite loop of insanity.

450
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:46,210
- If you know anything at all

451
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:50,381
or if there's anything
you can do to help me...

452
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:56,487
I need you to.

453
00:25:56,489 --> 00:25:59,523
- I can't help you.

454
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:02,660
- Are you really gonna let him
take the fall for this?

455
00:26:02,662 --> 00:26:06,063
Look at him,
a scared, small animal.

456
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,933
- Well, that's...
That's unacceptable.

457
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,801
- Oh.

458
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:13,704
Now he's doing what all small
animals do when they're scared,

459
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,806
pretend they're
bigger and scarier.

460
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:18,309
- Look, if you're not gonna do
anything about this,

461
00:26:18,311 --> 00:26:19,710
I'm afraid
you've left me no choice

462
00:26:19,712 --> 00:26:22,546
but to go to them
with what I know,

463
00:26:22,548 --> 00:26:25,249
which, given the things I know
about the day you left,

464
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,885
it's pretty damning.

465
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:31,922
Now, I'm asking you
one last time

466
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,425
to do the right thing.

467
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:36,327
- He does have a point.

468
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:39,229
He does know a lot,
perhaps too much.

469
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:43,033
I wonder, if I sliced open
his neck right now,

470
00:26:43,035 --> 00:26:45,269
would it be me doing it,
or would it be you?

471
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,871
- No.
- Yes.

472
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:51,375
I am going to go to them.

473
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:52,876
I'm going
to tell them everything.

474
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:55,446
Do you understand, Elliot?
Everything.

475
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:58,282
- Truth is, though,
it doesn't matter.

476
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,017
You start adding up
all the choices

477
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,219
you've been making,
they all add up to one thing.

any of us to do it?

We've already committed
$900 billion.

135
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:20,011
It would be irresponsible
if the feds sent more.

136
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,380
- And we're not going
to ask the government

137
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:23,382

138
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:24,816

144
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,065
we've already given you
our burst of cash on hand.

145
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,566
We can't give you any more.

146
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,435
- Well, we'll sell the T-bills
to the Chinese,

147
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,703
and that money in return

148
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:46,505
will be used as a loan
for our company.

149
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,908
Look, the real recovery program
is months from being done.

150
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,010
- The public is hoarding cash.

151
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,179
The housing market

157
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:06,892

to this problem.

158
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:08,727
This is not my opinion.

These are the facts,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,365
Now, I've cooperated
with you on every level.

161
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:16,568
I even have the goddamn FBI
working out of my offices.

162
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:22,574
Janet, Mary, Jack, please.

163
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,942
Tell me you didn't ask me

164
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,744
to fly down all the way to D.C.

165
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:28,747
just so you could, what,
hear yourselves complain?

166
00:07:31,084 --> 00:07:33,318
- You've got to resign.

167
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,786
We have no other options.

168
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,254

170
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:49,501
- In the fallout
of the Great Depression,

171
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:54,606
FDR closed all the banks
for a bank holiday,

172
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:58,343
and then he reopened them
in stages

173
00:07:58,345 --> 00:08:03,815
when they were reported
to being sound.

174
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:08,086
Later, historians discovered
what we in this room now know,

175
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:12,757
that those reports,
they were mostly lies.

176
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:16,595
Nevertheless, it worked.

177
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,798
It worked because
the public believed

178
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,268
the government
had everything under control.

179
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,840
You see, that is
the business model

180
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,375
for this great nation of ours.

181
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:32,544
Every business day
when that market bell rings,

182
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,747
we con people
into believing in something,

183
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:40,118

or family values.

00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,355
Could be freedom fries
for all I care.

185
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:46,324
It doesn't matter

186
00:08:46,326 --> 00:08:49,561
as long as the con works

187
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:54,065

188
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,135
whatever it is we want them to.

189
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:02,741
If I resign,

190
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:06,745
then any scrap of confidence

191
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:13,084

clinging onto will be destroyed,

192
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,186
and we all know

193
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:19,357
a con doesn't work

194
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:22,427
without the confidence.

195
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,333
If this was the best idea

196
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:32,070
you could come up
with for a win,

197
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:34,773
I shouldn't be
the one resigning.

198
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,443

199

<i>¶ Ding, dong, ding ¶</i>

30
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,769
All right, man,
explain this to me again.

31
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,639
Why are you taking me
to an arcade?

32
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:16,208
Well, I'm trying to tell you,
but you don't listen.

33
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,776
That's the problem
with your generation...

34
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,279
Too ADD to really
take in this world.

35
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:22,214
All right, all right,
break it down for me.

36
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:23,615
Well, to really get it,

37
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,452
I got to take you back to 1924.

38
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,787
Husband-and-wife team,
the Bedfords,

39
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,290
opened up a freak show/
dwarf sanctuary

40
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:32,624
on this land you're
about to be at.

41
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,093
Dwarf sanctuary?

42
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,261
Yeah, they called it
the Bedford Lilliputian...

43
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,629
A whole miniature city

44
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:39,832
scaled down for dwarf
and midget inhabitants.

45
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,400
I mean, they also
had other freaks

46
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:44,870
like lion-faced man,
limbless woman, shit like that.

47
00:01:44,872 --> 00:01:47,806
But the dwarves were
the big moneymaker.

48
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,142
Suffice to say, the Bedfords
were a big hit...

49
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,543
Lines around the corner,

50
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,713
the biggest attraction out here
in Coney Island.

51
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:55,814
Then one year, rumor has it,

52
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:58,450
the husband wakes up
one Christmas morning,

53
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,152
grabs a large kitchen knife,

54
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:02,154
slices his wife's throat open,

55
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:04,223
stabs his little kids to death,

56
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,791
then slits his own wrists.

57
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:08,660
- Huh.
- No motive was ever determined.

58
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,728
God.

59
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,164
Cut to the 1960s.

60
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:15,634
Woman named Mary Meghan Fisher
decided to buy up the place,

61
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,337
turned it into
an old-school arcade...

62
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,805
Pinball machines,
Skee-Ball, the likes.

63
00:02:19,807 --> 00:02:21,907
Called it "Games Games Games."

64
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,676
Shit, a bit on the nose,
if you ask me,

65
00:02:24,678 --> 00:02:26,178
not to mention repetitive,

66
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,913
but at least it had clarity.

67
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,882
Mary Meghan even
installed a little bar

68
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:31,350
so she could get drunk
with her friends

69
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,185
and shoot pool at night.

70
00:02:33,187 --> 00:02:34,786
And so she did,

71
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,922
almost every night...

72
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:39,825
till one time in '86,
she got so liquored up,

73
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,194
she accidentally fell
off the barstool

74
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,396
and landed hard on the pool cue
she was holding.

75
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,697
Oh.

76
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:47,366
Went right through
her neck, clean.

77
00:02:47,368 --> 00:02:48,867
Killed her right on the spot.

78
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:51,170
What in the fuck are you
telling me this for, man?

79
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:53,705
[door creaks and bangs]

80
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:00,412
Place remained dormant
until 2000,

81
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:03,482
when Ned Bosham bought up
the joint under the name

82
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:06,885
Fun Society Amusement LLC.

83
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,221
Ned wanted to reopen it
as a classic arcade.

84
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:12,524
Now, why anyone would want
to start an arcade in 2000

85
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:15,394
beats me, but Ned Bosham
had it in his mind

86
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,930
that that's what he wanted
to do, and so he did.

87
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:22,968
[clicking and creaking]

88
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,804
About a year ago, his oldest
son, Harold, wanted to sell it,

89
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:28,574
but Ned wasn't down with that.

90
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,476
So the oldest son, Harold, being
simpleminded and needing money

91
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:33,478
for whatever simpleminded
folks need money for,

92
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,647
decided Dad had to go.

93
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:39,218
So Harold stole his
twin brother's hunting rifle

94
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,553
and shot Dad in the face.

95
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,256
Now, what Harold
wasn't counting on,

96
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,924
considering he had never
fired a weapon before,

97
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,459
was the kickback.

98
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:49,494
It kicked back so hard,
he tripped and fell

99
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:50,696
out of his dad's
20-story window.

100
00:03:50,698 --> 00:03:51,930
[hisses]

101
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,765
By the time he hit the ground,
his head opened up

102
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,367
like one of those
Gallagher watermelons.

103
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,937
All this commotion stirred awake
his twin brother, Clyde,

104
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,973
who, as he told it to me,
was in his bedroom

105
00:04:00,975 --> 00:04:03,408
catching some Zs
when all this went down.

106
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,943
By the time he got his bearings,

107
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,279
he was immediately arrested
for the double homicide

108
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:08,480
of his brother and father,

109
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,983
being the weapon
was in his name.

110
00:04:10,985 --> 00:04:12,851
And how do you know Clyde?

111
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,353
He was my cellmate.

112
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:18,890
This place made him crazy.

113
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,325
He thinks it's cursed.

114
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,794
[whispering] Yeah.
No shit, Sherlock.

115
00:04:22,796 --> 00:04:24,997
Before I left the clink,
he gave me the keys to the joint

116
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,999
and made me swear
to burn it down

117
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,734
before it caused
any more ruckus.

118
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:30,402
He swears it's haunted...

119
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:33,905
Believes it is the nexus
of all evil in the universe.

120
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,844
You buy into any of this shit?

121
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:39,911
Fuck no, man.

122
00:04:39,913 --> 00:04:42,981
I'm too broke
to be superstitious.

123
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:46,652
In a way, all this hocus-pocus
keeps things clean

124
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,654
for whatever it is
you need to do.

125
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,322
The public records are in limbo.

126
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:52,891
People down in county don't even
want to touch the place.

127
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,860
I'm siphoning electricity
from the grid.

128
00:04:54,862 --> 00:04:57,029
As far as anyone's concerned,
it don't exist.

129
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,964
Now, on the market,
this joint would run you

130
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:00,866
about 5 grand a month,
but since it's you,

131
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:04,303
I'll give it
to your guy for half.

132
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:06,038
Come on, Mobley, don't
give me that look, man.

133
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,007
You know how hard it is
for an ex-con to get a job.

134
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,043
Money's tight,

135
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:12,944
especially with
my mom's cataracts.

136
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,413
The bills are adding up.

137
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:20,919
I'm not here to rent
from you, Romero.

138
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,721
I want you to work with us.

139
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:24,756
Oh, hell no, man.
I just got out.

140
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,892
I ain't trying to go back
no time soon.

141
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,360
Just hear my guy out, okay?

142
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,928
We need a phreaker.

143
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,563
Now, you know you're
the best in the game.

144
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,098
Don't try to sweet-talk me,
motherfucker.

145
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,367
I don't need you to tell me
who's the best in the game.

146
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,369
I invented the shit, okay?

147
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:40,739
Now, either you're renting,
or I'm finding somebody else,

148
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:43,408
but I cannot get mixed up
in whatever it is you're doing.

149
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,911
Man, this is a chance
to get back at the system

150
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:49,581
that stole six years
of your life.

151
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:54,753
This is a game changer, man.

152
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,856
Who's this guy, again?

153
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,925
He's, uh... He's a little weird.

154
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,828
But, uh, he's gonna
love this place.

155
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,864
He's got a thing
for Coney Island.

156
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,667
You'll like him.

157
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:10,068
Actually, you'll hate him.

158
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,838
But he's a genius.

159
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,873
Best coder I've ever met.

160
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,408
And he wants to meet you.

161
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,812
How much?

162
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,515
Aw, don't smile.
I ain't said yes yet.

163
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,851
Money's gonna be the deciding
factor in all this,

164
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,554
and it's gonna need to be
a whole lot to bring me back in.

165
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,023
That's the thing, man.

166
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,158
In a way,

167
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,894
this pays everything.

there was no sign of a robbery.

579
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:47,057
Someone was there

580
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,892

of offing him.

00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,299

It was just some wack-job.

587
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,907
Besides, I don't really care
discussing this with you,

588

which is exactly what we need
to be doing right now.

594
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:19,089
We might be getting executed

It's not the Dark Army.

597
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,796

598

599
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,532
They only communicate
through me,

600
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,768
and I sure as shit
didn't tell them anything.

601

they've talked to.

611

If they wanted us dead,
we'd be dead already.

612
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:06,970
Besides, if you're just
gonna end up in Arizona,

613
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,039
then being dead isn't
that much of a downgrade.

614

Ha-ha.

615
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,442
Then what do you
suggest we do, then?

616
00:30:15,047 --> 00:30:16,947
I'll talk to Elliot.

626
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,921
They're the only two that talked
to the Dark Army.

627
00:30:57,923 --> 00:31:00,991
Now they're trying to tell us
the Dark Army isn't involved.

628

What are you saying?

629
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:07,998
I'm saying we just committed
the crime of the century,

630
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,867
and they're trying
to cover their tracks.

631
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:12,536
And right now, we're the tracks.

632
00:31:18,177 --> 00:31:22,212
A lot of life
is a balancing act.

the physical condition

641
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,040
kind of cancels that out.

642
00:31:50,042 --> 00:31:53,977
And I'd like to say upfront...

643
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:58,081
I'm very sorry this
happened to you.

644

On that tip, I still need you
to fix this thing for me.

you're making,

A few weeks of being
frozen in my own grief,

1026
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:35,277
I woke up one morning,

1027
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:37,813
fixed myself breakfast

1030
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:43,752
and started talking...

1031
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:45,988
out loud.

1032
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:48,724
For a second,
I thought I was crazy.

1033
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:49,858
Moved on with the day.

1034
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,861
Then the next day,
I did it again...

1035
00:53:52,863 --> 00:53:53,996
Talked out loud...

1036
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:56,298
And the next.

1037
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,801
And then I realized
who I was talking to.

1038
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:06,642

all of this?

1039

about your son's murder.

1048

took all your joints.

1050
00:55:02,967 --> 00:55:03,999
I looked through your files.

1051

I also know you have arthritis

1052
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,036
and probably can't
roll 'em yourself,

1053
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:11,373
so I'm guessing your son did.

1054

I can help roll 'em for you
if you'd like.

someone did come,

Nope, not with these cataracts.

Well, what does that
say about us, then,

281

282
00:17:18,271 --> 00:17:20,471
We're bringing in all the people
from these photos,

283
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,740
cross-checking all social media,
Facebook, Twitter.

284
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,776
So they threw a party. So what?

285
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:26,177
Everyone threw one of these

parties that night.

287
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,647
What about the flyer?

288
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:32,250
We checked on
the DJ name, Mobley.

289
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,252
Appears to be a DJ out in Vegas.

290
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,521
Just your average,
middle-of-the-road player.

291
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,356
Nobody of note.

292
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:40,391
He was doing a show out there
at Caesar's that night.

293
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,593
It checks.
I'm not sure of the connection.

294
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,796
Why don't you just
break it down for us, Dom?

295
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:47,765
What hard evidence
do we actually have here?

296
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,238
Found this tucked behind

297
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,807
that "Mallard Murder"
game over there.

298
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:01,179
How do you know
no one followed you?

299
00:18:01,181 --> 00:18:03,481
They think I'm in a yoga class.

mixed up with you.

Rather than repeating

he gave me,

and the next day you had
these guys arrested,

421
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,685
which means at every move,

422
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,788
he has followed through
on exactly what he's offered.

423
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,224
He's given me
everything I wanted.

I have a nice apartment,
a nice job.

425
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,095
He had no leverage
against me before,

426
00:24:58,097 --> 00:25:00,931
so he created it.

427
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,933
So you're saying everything
he's been doing is

428
00:25:02,935 --> 00:25:04,969

against you?

429

What about all that stuff
you said about them valuing you?

430
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,207
You're the one that thought
it was suspicious

431
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,909
that they offered me a job
in the first place.

He's trying to negotiate.

434

If he's creating leverage,

435
00:25:18,885 --> 00:25:21,285
it means that he needs
something from me.

[sighs heavily]

459
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:37,962
Us.

You win, you can confess

461
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,334
to the JFK assassination
for all I care.

462
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:46,170

Remember what happened to you?

474

All I remember is, I woke up
in Tyrell Wellick's car

475
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:23,741
three days later.

476
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:26,143

That's what.

480
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:41,692
The absence of knowing.

481
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:45,262
Losing time forever.

482
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:50,067
A deep, black void

483
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:54,338
that you will never
come back from.

484
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,906
No thoughts.

485
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,041
No body.

486
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,043
No memories.

487
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:03,380
Absolute nothingness.

You think I want this, Elliot?

491
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,060
This futile battle we're in?

492
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:19,096
Two halves at perpetual war?

00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:40,184
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

500
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,288
I'm thinking about his offer.

501
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,830
Is he the only person
you interact with?

502
00:28:52,832 --> 00:28:54,932
<i>Don't worry.</i>

503
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,334
<i>You're safe.</i>

504
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,769
Yes.

505
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:03,807
Elliot...

506
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:06,410
do you think I could
talk to him?

507
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,145
No.

508
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,147
Why not?

509
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:12,483
It would legitimize him.

510
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,123
At this point, I think
we have to accept the fact

511
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:22,359
that he is a legitimate
existence in your life.

512
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,095
That's giving him
too much power.

513
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,430
In order for us
to figure this out,

514
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:27,831
we have to acknowledge...

515
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:30,300
What do you want from me?

516
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:34,104
You know everything.

517
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:38,776
You want me to keep
repeating myself?

518
00:29:38,778 --> 00:29:42,980
You want me to tell you
that I see my dead father?

519
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,315
That I talk to him?

520
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,384
That sometimes I lose time?

521
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,019
That there are gaps in my life

522
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,854
where I don't know
what happened?

523
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:53,257
That I'm losing my mind?

524
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,460
That I didn't even
recognize my own sister?

525
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,929
That I don't know
how to control this thing?

526
00:29:58,931 --> 00:30:00,330
I don't know how to stop it?

527
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,498
Fine!

528
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,909
[whispers] Yeah.

529
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,110
Fine.

530
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,845
I acknowledge it.

531
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:22,052
But let's move on to the part
where you actually help me.

532
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:28,959
This game you are agreeing
to is dangerous, Elliot.

533
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:35,199
You are agreeing to destroy
a part of yourself,

534
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,301
win or lose,

535
00:30:37,303 --> 00:30:39,236
so yes, this matters

536
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:43,040
a great deal, actually.

537
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:45,108
For better or worse,
he is a part of you

538
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,346
that makes you<i> you.</i>

539
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,149
Annihilation is not the answer.

540
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,019
<i>Krista's wrong.</i>

541
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,456
<i>Annihilation is always
the answer.</i>

542
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:02,459
<i>We destroy parts
of ourselves every day.</i>

543
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:05,229
<i>We Photoshop our warts away.</i>

544
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:07,898
<i>We edit the parts
we hate about ourselves,</i>

545
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,467
<i>modify the parts
we think people hate.</i>

546
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:12,369
<i>We curate our identity,</i>

547
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:15,205
<i>carve it, distill it.</i>

548
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,274
<i>Krista's wrong.</i>

549
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,543
<i>Annihilation is all we are.</i>

550
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,145
I fail to see the logic.

551
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:25,148
Why put all your faith in her
when we have other options?

552
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,516
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

553
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:30,554
We could blow up
the whole Western Hemisphere,

554
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,890
but you know me.

555
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,124
I'm old-fashioned.

556
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:36,526
I always opt
for the simpler path.

557
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:39,363
<i>Occam's razor and all that.</i>

558
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:42,432
Be that as it may,
it is a slower path,

559
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,234
and time is of the essence,
Phillip.

560
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,236
I want to remind you
that closing the plant

561
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,038
is not an option.

562
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,073
[beeping]

563
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,112
And how many minutes
have you allotted

564
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,514
for this phone call?

565
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:59,950
<i>I didn't start this game.</i>

566
00:31:59,952 --> 00:32:02,452

I'm being pressured to resign.

568
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:07,057
Confidence in the market
is at an all-time low,

569
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,092
and what are you up to?

570
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:12,296
<i>You're not doing anything
on your end to help.</i>

571
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:14,298
<i>I'm handling this.</i>

572
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,000
Just like I said I would.

573
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:19,136
Have you spoken
to the administration?

574
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:21,605
Mm-mm, we're not there yet.

575
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:24,074
President isn't
desperate enough.

576
00:32:24,076 --> 00:32:26,376
<i>We need the pressure
to cook a little more.</i>

577
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:30,180
You assured me that the UN
vote would be in full swing.

578
00:32:30,182 --> 00:32:33,116
<i>You're the time master.</i>

579
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:37,621

Rome may have burned in a day,

Why the fuck are you in my home?

586
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,301
Your housekeeper let me in.

587
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:39,843
There seems to be a problem with
my husband's severance package.

588
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:44,748
That sounds like
an issue for HR.

589
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,149
Yes.

590
00:34:46,151 --> 00:34:48,385
I've spoken to them already.

591
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,220
Several times, in fact.

592
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,590
They claim they can't
release it yet.

593
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:57,360
Yeah, there seems to be
a problem for me, too.

594
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:04,501
I can't seem to find the person
who murdered my wife.

595
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:10,173
Bureaucracy is a bitch, right?

596
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:15,445
You want my husband.

597
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,482
I can understand that.

598
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:21,184
And I would like
the money I'm owed.

599
00:35:21,186 --> 00:35:24,187
So why don't we help
each other, then?

600
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,689
I'll testify my husband
didn't come home

601
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,358
the night of the murder.

602
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,127
I left the party alone...

603
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:34,698
Didn't see him
till the next day.

604
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,567
I'll agree to that if you
release the severance package.

[laughs drily]

606
00:35:44,143 --> 00:35:46,409

It's making the Dark Army

Okay, get it together, dude.

692

698
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:06,963

Yeah, well, they have something,

701
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,536
and Romero must have
found out about it.

702
00:41:13,538 --> 00:41:15,605
He had a printout with a roster

snooping around,

on the account, like,

732
00:42:32,884 --> 00:42:34,150
you supposed to be
helping people

733
00:42:34,152 --> 00:42:35,318
if they're in trouble.

734
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,086
Like it was your duty

735
00:42:37,088 --> 00:42:41,024

then you get arrested.

Nobody.

746
00:43:17,662 --> 00:43:20,863
You know, back in
the Age of Enlightenment,

747
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,365
motherfuckers used chess

748
00:43:22,367 --> 00:43:25,868

749
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:29,038
'cause there wasn't no
Tony Robbins DVDs back then.

This was it.

751
00:43:31,977 --> 00:43:34,611
So what you playing for then?

752
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,614

then what's the what?

753

asked yourself this before.

to be here right now?

like, here-here,

could be beautiful,

You can think all

00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:21,837
the moves I'm making

885
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:23,772
you're telling me to make.

<i>The number of 40-move games</i>

00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,862
<i>You just need to be able

896

Three in a row.

The odds of that are...

902
00:53:08,352 --> 00:53:09,818
Impossible.

914
00:53:55,666 --> 00:53:57,433
No.

Our fight for that future

00:54:16,988 --> 00:54:18,621

922
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:20,956
It's what you do out there

923
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:26,762
I want to be here, Elliot.

924
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:28,497
With you.

925
00:54:44,315 --> 00:54:48,517
I want an office
on the 20th floor.

926
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:51,654
I want Melissa's job,
and it's non-negotiable.

Go on.

928
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:06,068
I saw the pattern.

929
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,070
In every version
of the settlement draft

930
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:10,639
for the Washington
Township suit,

931
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,510
there was one small point that
your team wouldn't agree on.

932
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:18,747
It remained the same,
even from the original case:

933
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:22,584
That a third-party company
must perform inspections

934
00:55:22,586 --> 00:55:25,587
on the Washington
Township plant.

935
00:55:25,589 --> 00:55:28,724
You continue to give up power
on all these other provisions

936
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:32,428
that appear to be a lot more
expensive and important,

937
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,398
all in an attempt
to drop this one small point.

938
00:55:37,635 --> 00:55:39,568
I know why you had
those guys arrested

939
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,837
and why you gave me this job.

940
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,972
You want me to convince
the class

941
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:46,342
to remove the contingency,

942
00:55:46,344 --> 00:55:48,043
and I'm willing to do
all of that,

943
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:51,580
because you're gonna give me

944
00:55:51,582 --> 00:55:53,115
exactly what I want in return.

945
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:04,493
Those are my terms.

946
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:12,935

But I'm sorry, my dear.

Five/Nine investigation,

to both you and Elliot.

it was mailed from.

311
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,889

472
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,234
in our family room growing up.

473
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:53,303
I found this in Germany.
The town of Rothenburg.

474
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:55,005
Cost me a fortune.

475
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,207
The seller told me
that it was one of a kind.

476
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:58,709
[scoffs]

477
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:00,944
So much for the honest salesman.
[chuckles]

478
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,881
My parents bought theirs
at a Kmart in Teaneck.

479
00:28:04,884 --> 00:28:07,317
Oh, is that where you're from?

480
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,787
Miss... Jersey born and raised.

481
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,388
And my full name
is Dominique DiPierro,

482
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,923
but I go by Dom.

483
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:14,458
Or Agent DiPierro.

484
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,894
Or just Dom.

485
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:22,099
So if I can ask,

486
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,434
what's the deal with the clocks?

487
00:28:23,436 --> 00:28:27,404
Is it a punctuality thing?

488
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:30,741
"Life is but a walking shadow,

489
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:33,177

"his hour upon the stage

491

and then is heard no more."

492
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,820
You've surrounded yourself

493
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:45,489
with the constant reminder
of mortality.

494
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,726
There's much work to do,
great work.

495
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,327
As each second passes,

496
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:53,230
I push myself to keep moving.

497
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,966
You're making me think
I should invest

498
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:57,234
in a decent watch.

499
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,203
[laughs softly]

500
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,073
Now, if I may ask,

501
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,475
how does a young woman
from New Jersey

502
00:29:04,477 --> 00:29:06,877
find her way into the FBI?

503
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,915
I was...

504
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:14,485
I am...

505
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:18,188
disgusted by the selfish
brutality of the world,

506
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,159
but at the same time,
I'm utterly fascinated by it.

507
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:25,195
The FBI's a perfect place
for that kind of contradiction.

508
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,834
I have something in my office
I think you might appreciate.

509
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,807
The artist strives to reflect
the desolation and anxiety

510
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:40,277
that accompanies
one's loss of identity.

511
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,981
His message is subversive
to many in our country.

512
00:29:43,983 --> 00:29:47,384
Nevertheless,
the work appeals to the masses

513
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,520
and to the individual.

514
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:53,357
How is it that revolution
can create such beautiful art

515
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:55,125
yet you and I are
tracking revolutionaries

516
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:57,561
who've created
nothing but turmoil?

517
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,433
There's more to the story.

518
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,968
I'm sorry?

519
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,370
FBI.

520
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,405
Why you joined.

521
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,443
What was it?

522
00:30:13,445 --> 00:30:16,446
It's a little personal.

523
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,183
That's precisely why I'm asking.

524
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,920
Oh.

525
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,424
Okay.

526
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:29,827
[chuckles nervously] Um...

527
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:34,865
Well, it was
a certain relationship.

528
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,002
A love story?

529
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:44,308
Of sorts. Sort of, sure.

530
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,243
Final semester of law school,

531
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,946
dating who I thought
was the one,

532
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:50,214
at dinner,

533
00:30:50,216 --> 00:30:53,617
days before graduation...

534
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:56,153
they got down on one knee
to propose, and...

535
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,261
This is gonna
make me sound wacky,

536
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,463
but I...

537
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:09,600
excused myself to the restroom
and went out the back, and...

538
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:15,038
That was that.

539
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,074
Fast-forward several years,
I turn around,

540
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:20,043
and here's
what I picked instead.

541
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,446
A mid-level field agent.

542
00:31:24,984 --> 00:31:26,884
[laughs softly]

543
00:31:29,021 --> 00:31:31,054
- What is it?
- I just...

544
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:33,991
Uh, I never would have...
[laughs]

545

Expected to be talking
about an old flame

546
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:40,030
to China's minister
of state security.

547
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,633
- Ah.
- [laughs]

548
00:31:42,635 --> 00:31:44,468
It'll make a good story
at Thanksgiving.

549
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,969
My dad'll love it.

550

552
00:32:07,026 --> 00:32:09,126
Wow.

for the royal families.

Purchased in Shanghai.

561

Let me ask, Miss DiPierro,

570
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,122
have you ever wondered
how the world would look

571
00:33:12,124 --> 00:33:15,392
if the Five/Nine hack
never happened?

572
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:18,762
How the world would look
right now?

573
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:22,299
In fact, some believe
there are alternate realities

574
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:25,302
playing out that very scenario,

575
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,771
with other lives
that we're leading...

576
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,408

577
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,310
that we've become.

578
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:43,687

very deeply.

You really do have a thing...

582
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,068
I apologize, I must go.

583

Because I wanna be.

588
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,307
I told Darlene
I didn't want you involved.

589
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,643
She was right to involve me.

590
00:34:39,645 --> 00:34:42,746
Please don't do this.
I'll find another way.

591
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:45,348
Darlene said it's a simple job.

592
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:49,753
I place the device on the floor
and walk away.

Best-case scenario:
I lose my job

and plea-bargain down
a jail sentence.

602
00:35:08,574 --> 00:35:10,640
I'm backed into a corner.

603
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,577
Either I act,
or I wait to get caught.

604
00:35:17,349 --> 00:35:20,283
I told myself that I would wait
to decide until I saw you

605
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,252
because you wouldn't
let me walk into this

that you could pull it off.

607

00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:25,643
Started to develop a cough
two weeks ago.

371
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,179
She got pretty frail
pretty quick.

372
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:31,382
Fell over a few times.

373
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,684
According to the vet,

374
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:35,353
she danced
with the wrong mosquito,

375
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,422
got herself a...

376
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:40,825
nasty case of heartworm.

377
00:17:40,827 --> 00:17:44,262
She was moved to a little room
off the basement,

378
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:47,465
had a water heater
for a roommate.

379
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,434
Before she got sick,

380
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,737
Maxine lived
like her own operator.

381
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:55,206
Didn't seem to cross her mind
that she belonged to someone.

382
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,278
But in that basement,
she needed human hands

383
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,480
to give her every scrap of food,

384
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,815
every pill...

385
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,718
Occasional light.

386

[whimpering]

388
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:24,702
For the first time, she realized

389
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,504
that she continues to breathe

390
00:18:26,506 --> 00:18:29,807
because someone else allowed it,

391
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,510
that she had a master.

392
00:18:32,512 --> 00:18:34,846
[rasping]

393
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,849
Now, I'm no vet,

394
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,884
but I think that realization
might have killed her

395
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:42,353
before the parasites
had a chance.

396
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:46,891

397
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:50,528
Anyway, I'ma quit yapping,

398
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,264
let you rest.

399
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,133
Big days ahead.

400
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:56,534

You heard what Angela said.

424
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,427
An inter-office email
stating that the FBI's CART team

425
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,362
is vacating E Corp tomorrow.

426
00:19:58,364 --> 00:19:59,597

once they're back
at the field office.

428
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,533
She'll be ready.

429
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,868
Darlene.

430
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,703
We just started teaching her.

431
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,473
For someone like Angela,
learning all of this in 24 hours

432
00:20:09,475 --> 00:20:11,809
is next to impossible.

433
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:14,545
Uh... that?

434
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,684
Okay, uh, you know what?

435
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,619
It's... pause.

436
00:20:21,621 --> 00:20:25,523
Maybe you need to... sometimes
it helps to visualize it, okay?

437
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:26,824
So here.

438
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,660
Your network cable
is gonna be plugged

439
00:20:29,662 --> 00:20:31,295
into one of these suckers.

440
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:33,864
That's a battery-powered
home-brewed mobile tower

441
00:20:33,866 --> 00:20:35,533
called a femtocell.

442
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:38,536
Now, this guy won't help us
get on the FBI network.

443
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,571
That won't be accessible
at E Corp.

444
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,473
What this guy will do is force

445
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:44,976
every FBI cell phone
to connect to it

446
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:49,280
so it can get every email,
text message, and document.

447
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:53,351
Now, you SSH in,
run the first script.

448
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:57,355

00:20:57,357 --> 00:21:00,324

00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:12,870
No... Uh, that's...

454
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,772
Yeah.

455
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:16,507
I will get this.

456
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,342
Let's just try it again.

457
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:20,411
Mm-hmm.

458
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:23,281
Um...

459
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,282
okay.

460
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,417
This is a Rubber Ducky.

461
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,354
All else fails, you find an FBI
laptop anywhere on the floor.

462
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:32,523
They're usually
Panasonic Toughbooks.

463
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,791
Plug this guy in,

464
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,960
wait 15 seconds,
then yank it, okay?

465
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,329
Thanks to a tool
called mimikatz,

466
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,032
it'll pull all cached passwords
and domain info in

467
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:42,066
and save them on this.

468
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,534
Won't give us everything

469
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,770
but might help lead us
somewhere.

470
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:48,372
Just a backup plan.

471
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:50,975
Okay. Let's try again. [Claps]

472
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:54,679
You can't teach someone
to hack in one day, okay?

473
00:21:54,681 --> 00:21:56,347
I don't know how we'll
be ready by tomorrow.

474
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,082
We need more time.
Well, we don't have it.

475
00:21:58,084 --> 00:22:00,685
And once they leave E Corp,
we're done.

476
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:03,654
Okay, just keep working
on the scripts with Angela.

477
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,523
Rise and repeat,
again and again.

478
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,458
Wax on, wax off.

479
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,494
Do whatever you got to do,
but this is happening.

480
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,596
Okay, the holdup
on the femtocell

481
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,031
isn't helping either, okay?

482
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:16,467
I still need to load
the exploit, need to test it...

483
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,935
It'll be here.

484
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,104

and swapping antennas.

Excuse me, but I disagree.

We were there
to investigate the hack,

522
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,158
and then we were under fire.

523
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,793
That is not a coincidence.

524
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:59,230
By all reports,
the Dark Army are just hackers.

525
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:00,998
It's not their MO

would have taken more victims.

528

I clipped one of the shooters
in the leg.

529
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,507
He went down, hit the floor.

530
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,608
He could have kept firing.

531
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,942
I read the reports, DiPierro.

532
00:25:11,944 --> 00:25:14,044
He turned the gun on himself.

533
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,881
He erased his history.

534
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:19,783
And the other shooter
actually had me cornered.

535
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,685
I was done.

536
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,854
Swear to God.

537
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,289
But instead, for some reason,

538
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:26,924
he also put his weapon
to his head

539
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:29,627
and pulled the trigger.

540
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:31,529
Their mission wasn't
to slaughter us.

00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,298
If it was, I wouldn't be here
arguing with you right now.

542
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,267
They were there to disrupt
our investigation,

543
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:37,635
to send us home,

544
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:39,603

00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:21,132

I thought I was helping you.

I thought I was
gonna be your savior.

323

324
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,610
She was so smart.

325

326
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,417
She was like you,

327
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,519
real good with computers.

328
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,155
That's what she did
for a living.

329
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:47,425
So when she had
this idea to do a site,

330
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,661
it sounded good to me.

331
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:56,267
I don't think she ever meant it
to go where it went.

332
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:59,704
She was wanting to make
some extra scratch.

333
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,173
But the thing grew so fast,

334
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:05,343
it took on a life of its own.

00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,478

we made a deal.

341
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:21,159
Decided we'd let
the market dictate

342
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,561
what was sold on the site.

343
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,563
And we wouldn't look.

344
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,402
She was better
at the denial than me.

00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,983
Now, all of a sudden,
I got no access.

504
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:09,753
Can't even make new sales
'cause the site's down.

505
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:12,890
All of this is on you.

506
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:14,758
So the way I see it,

507
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,761
You're paying me back.

508
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,935
We'll get some one-on-one

509
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:27,237
later on.

510
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:33,177
[players chattering]

511
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:44,254
Just remember, cuz,

512
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:47,991
sitting under
the Sword of Damocles.

513
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,231
Out of the blue,

514
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:56,900
I received a call
from my lawyer.

515
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,137
Seems the contingency
on our biggest lawsuit

516
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:03,307
was miraculously dropped.

517
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:06,043
Care to explain?

518
00:29:06,045 --> 00:29:08,979
It's what you wanted, isn't it?

519
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,214
I remember telling you

520
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,249
exactly the opposite.

521
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:15,018
You just didn't
want to ask for it.

522
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:19,022
But it is what you wanted.

523
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,827
You gonna take the offer then?

524
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:29,133
Well, it's not for me to say,

525
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:31,935
officially, but...

526
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:34,037
despite the fact that
we're hemorrhaging money

527
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,839
at the moment,

528
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:37,274
settling this would be
a lot cheaper than

529
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:41,044
dealing with the legal expense.

530
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:43,347
Can I ask why
it was so important for you

531
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,250
to drop this contingency?

532
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,257
You protecting some

533
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:56,059
evil, secret agenda?

534
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:00,297
Aren't we all protecting our

535
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,800
evil, secret agendas?

536
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,374
In that case,

537
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,376
here's mine.

538
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:14,011
One of the things
that Terry Colby

539
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,046
said to me when I took this job

540
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:19,850
was I could make changes
from within.

541
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,420
I want my position moved

542
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,355
to the Risk Management
Department.

543
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:27,357
There's a manager position
available.

544
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,293
And even though I may
lack the experience,

545
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:31,428
I think you know I can
more than make up for it

546
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,896
with drive

547
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:34,231
and quick learning.

548
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:36,900
That's how you choose
to squander the capital

549
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,969
you've just earned...

550
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,871
You're aware that's a

551
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:42,005
lateral move?

552
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,974
It's what I want.

553
00:30:55,888 --> 00:30:58,322
And I am asking.

554
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:09,066
It's my birthday today.

555
00:31:10,603 --> 00:31:14,104
Did you know that?

556
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15,138
No.

557
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,274
Hm.

558
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,475
- I thought...
- No, no...

559
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,143
Don't believe what you
read online.

560
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,144
Today

561
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:25,015
is my actual birthday.

562
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,351
I never share
the real one with anyone.

563
00:31:27,353 --> 00:31:30,420
Some things I like
to keep to myself.

564
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:38,028
Happy birthday then.

565
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,898
[chuckles]

566
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,271
Would you like to

567
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:49,206
celebrate

568
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:52,042
with me?

569
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,177
Tonight?

570
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:01,084
No.

571
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,330
Well, maybe next year.

572
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,369
<i>Wither thou goest
to possess them</i>

573
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,104
<i>and thou succeedest them,</i>

574
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,374
and dwellest in their land.

575
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:27,077
Amen.

576
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:29,279
All: Amen.

577
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:50,233
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.

578
00:32:50,235 --> 00:32:52,970
For my outburst last month.

579
00:33:02,247 --> 00:33:04,448
Can you let go of me, please?

580
00:33:07,052 --> 00:33:10,387
I know you're afraid,

581
00:33:10,389 --> 00:33:13,523
but the fear you have
is a right one.

582
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:17,995
It means you'll be
forever vigilant.

583
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:20,130
You want to know how I know?

584
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:25,202
I've seen you talking to Him.

585
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:28,372
Not out loud, but I could tell.

586
00:33:28,374 --> 00:33:31,441
It's written all over your face.

587
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,111
It's not crazy, Elliot,

588
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:38,048
it's very normal.

589
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,550
You've seen me talking to him?

590
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:42,419
Yes.

591
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,489
But you don't have to
keep it such a secret.

592
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:51,428
When you let Jesus
into your heart,

593
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,331
He'll always listen.

594
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:01,571
Tell you what,

595
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:04,574
I'll give you some alone time.

I need your help.

I've been lost
these past few weeks.

Since the whole Ray thing.

601
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:55,225

605
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:16,513
Why did you first
start listening to me?

606
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:21,451
When I sent you that note

607
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:25,455
on the server at Evil Corp,

608
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:29,192
something inside you
told you to listen.

609
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:32,195
And you did.

610
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,663
Followed me off the subway,

611
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,466
came to fsociety,

612
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,734
and then you...

613
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,302
Not me...

614
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:43,373
Led us to hack Evil Corp.

615
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,209
I didn't force you
to do any of it.

616
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:47,611
It was all you.

617
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:49,613
Your choice.

618
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,748
Truth is,

619
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,751
I just followed your lead.

620
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,659
People want to follow you, son.

621
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:06,496
Why?

622
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,698
Same reason why
you led the entire world

623
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:11,535
into a revolution.

624
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:15,172

626
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:24,314
I don't want to be a leader.

627

You asked me how to finish this.

628
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,751
That's what you need to do.

629
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,586
You need to lead.

People in this bullpen,
these are your

risk management coordinators,

635
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:43,433
you'll be working
with this team.

636
00:36:43,435 --> 00:36:45,535
Put out risk reports, analyses,

637
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,337
and you report everything
out to me.

638
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:49,606
After Five/Nine,
almost all of our time

639
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:53,343

the crisis response team.

That's what we do here.

about ways to

00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,355
address the crisis
and course correct.

645
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:07,290
Need you to be smart.

646
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,726
Think outside the box
and be discreet.

647
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,528
You get in; You get out;

648
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,762
Assess the situation quickly;

649
00:37:12,764 --> 00:37:14,331
Find answers;

650
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:18,401
Figure out ways to limit damage.

651
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:20,437
I'm giving you access

to the case
we're working on now.

over water contamination.

00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,248
Nothing public yet, but

656
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,282
could be big

00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,251
first quarter, 2016.

658
00:37:34,253 --> 00:37:35,785
Do I just go into
the file server

659
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:36,786
to access that?

660
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:38,455
I'll have IT

We worked together
on a couple projects

00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:50,533
when he was a vendor.

667
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:53,737
It's terrible
what happened to him.

668
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:56,740
Well, why don't you go ahead
and get yourself up to speed?

669
00:37:56,742 --> 00:37:59,542
I'll check in once a week.

670
00:37:59,544 --> 00:38:03,280
Let me know
if you need anything.

00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:14,424
Can I sit in
on the daily debrief meeting?

[sighs] Look,

674
00:38:16,695 --> 00:38:17,894
that's, uh,

675
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:19,729
that's a director-level meeting.

676
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,564
We don't really invite
managers to that.

677
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:22,899
If I could just sit and listen

678
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,901
it might help me
get up to speed faster.

679
00:38:24,903 --> 00:38:26,703
I want to make sure
I can add value

680
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,439
as soon as possible.

681
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:30,607
All right.

00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:32,475
It's later this afternoon.

683
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,778
I'll send you an invite
with the details.

685
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:41,918
okay this morning
with these protestors out here?

<i>it's never about
the destination.</i>

695
00:39:16,722 --> 00:39:19,522
<i>It's about the journey.</i>

696
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:23,760

You know what else
your problem is?

705
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:45,815
Too much courage.

706
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:47,517
Just like your nigger friend.

707
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:48,585
People might tell you
it's a good thing,

708
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:49,786
but it ain't always.

709
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,755

You could've avoided this

00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,710
Think about that.

720
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,713

Hey, yo, man,

728
00:40:57,756 --> 00:41:02,058
when you see Whiterose,

729
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,861
make sure you say
I did you good.

730
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,898
[groans]

731
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,607
I'll be rooting for you, cuz.

732
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,843
Always.

733
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:37,994
Usually, they feed us.

734
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,095
It's one of the only reasons

735
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,597
to come to these meetings.

736
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:41,965
Should we go ahead and start?

737
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,800
It doesn't look like
Susan's gonna make it.

738
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:45,502
Is there any reason to have
this meeting without her?

739
00:41:45,504 --> 00:41:46,903
The economy must really
be in the shitter

740
00:41:46,905 --> 00:41:50,874
if Susan Jacobs finally decided
to take her vacation days.

741
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,709
First order of business

742
00:41:52,711 --> 00:41:54,777
is the small independent
loan companies we're servicing.

743
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:55,912
I'm surprised they're
not suing us

744
00:41:55,914 --> 00:41:57,514
for breach of
the uptime clauses.

745
00:41:57,516 --> 00:41:58,681
I have three class actions on

746
00:41:58,683 --> 00:41:59,983
that point alone in my region.

747
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,918
Contractual damage
on uptime are minimal.

748
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,019
I'm not even worried about it.

749
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:04,787
We'll settle.

750
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:06,956
But we should discuss those
when Susan comes back.

751
00:42:06,958 --> 00:42:09,659
Maybe it would be helpful
if I put together a summary

752
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:12,729
of how we've...
handled past cases.

753
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:14,063
To see if there are
any patterns that might

754
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,966
help us figure out
how to address this issue.

755
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,970
If we pull milestone cases

756
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:23,573
like Dakota Fracking and

757
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,108
Washington Township,

758
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,077
I could put together
a summary briefing.

759
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:34,050
All I would need
is access to the files

760
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,719
and then I could get
working on that right away.

761
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:52,168
[sighs]

762
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,571
You know what?

763
00:42:54,573 --> 00:42:57,173
There's not much
we can do here today.

764
00:42:57,175 --> 00:43:00,610
Food never came, Susan's out.

765
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:01,878
Let's adjourn.

766
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,179
Didn't I just say that
two minutes ago?

767
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:04,914
We're really leaving
before the food?

768
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,950
I said adjourned.

769
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,603
I know who you are.

770
00:43:26,605 --> 00:43:27,704
You did what you did

771
00:43:27,706 --> 00:43:29,138
to get a job here.

772
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,808
You sucked whoever's dick
to get transferred here.

773
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,177
And, frankly,
I don't really care.

774
00:43:36,114 --> 00:43:39,749
This is a favor to Price.

775
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:41,651
You know what he told me,

776
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:44,020
when I asked him
how I should deal with you?

777
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:47,824
He said, and I quote,

778
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:50,827
"However you want."

779
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,772
Enjoy the shrimp cocktail.

780
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:07,710
This is good news,
don't you think?

781
00:44:16,388 --> 00:44:19,055
But you're not happy about it.

782
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:24,927
I'm not sure.

783
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:27,930
When did you get it?

784
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:30,133
This morning.

785
00:44:33,138 --> 00:44:36,072
How are your
interactions with him?

786
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,942
For the first time,

787
00:44:39,944 --> 00:44:42,945
we trust each other.

788
00:44:42,947 --> 00:44:46,149
I help him, and he helps me.

789
00:44:47,452 --> 00:44:49,252
Since I've been at my mom's,

790
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:52,755
I wanted to get rid of him.

791
00:44:52,757 --> 00:44:56,292
But you were right.

792
00:44:56,294 --> 00:45:00,296
You can't destroy
a part of yourself.

793
00:45:06,771 --> 00:45:10,206
Elliot, I need to
ask you a question.

794

Where do you think
you are right now?

795
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:21,184
What do you mean?

796
00:45:25,857 --> 00:45:29,992

Okay, just be quick.

328
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,379
I'll wait in the stairwell.

329
00:18:16,863 --> 00:18:18,729
Mom?

330
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:31,209
They taking care of you?

331
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:35,213
Room looks nice.

332
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:40,451
I'll see if they can
fix the clock.

333
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,487
Looks like it's broken.

334
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,526
How are you?

335
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,802
A lot's happened

336
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,638
since last I saw you.

337
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,373
Had a really hard time.

338
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:06,878
Anyway,

339
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,547
just wanted to say thank you.

340
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,154
You helped me survive
these last couple months.

341
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,592
I don't think I could have
done it without you.

342
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,475
Okay.

343
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,717
Take care.

345
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,369

354
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,891
You hit me in the face
with a fucking bat!

355
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,426
Thank God I didn't need
stitches!

356
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:37,295
Well, I should have
hit you harder.

357
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:39,630
Dear God, we've been over this
for the last three weeks.

358
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,300
Okay, I've walked you through
every IRC conversation.

359
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:44,435
I am not gonna let this go.

360
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:45,970
Why the fuck are you
sending pictures of me

361
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,438
while I'm asleep
to the Dark Army?

362
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,573
How many times
do I have to tell you?

363
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:50,975
Letting them know you're
with me keeps you safe.

364
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,610
I was trying to protect you.

365
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:54,578
Then why aren't you
telling me about Stage 2

366
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,347
and what you guys did
with the femtocell?

367
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:57,748
We've been over this
a million...

368
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,718

got to calm down!

Here's what we're gonna do.

Elliot?

00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,426
Come back to Earth.

381
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,462
I thought you wanted
to find Mobley and Trenton?

[quietly] Yeah.

383
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:57,575
Yeah.

384
00:22:57,577 --> 00:23:00,878
We need to know
what happened to them, right?

385
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,381
[scoffs]
I can't keep up with you two.

386
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:04,849
Look, I'm not risking my life
to help with this.

387
00:23:04,851 --> 00:23:06,417
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

388
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,685
Your Dark Army contact.

389
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,953
You have one?

390
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:09,954
You must.

[exhales sharply]

392
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,962
If they find out
I was involved, it'll be my ass.

393
00:23:17,964 --> 00:23:20,064
Okay?
I'll be the next one missing.

394
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,766
Only there won't be
any questions

395
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,601
about where I went.

396
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:31,075
You better be more reliable
than your sister.

397
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:44,688
Hey,

398
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,124
what the hell just happened?

399
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:49,960
I was gonna ask you the same.

400
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,166
Why were you talking with them?

401
00:23:55,168 --> 00:23:56,834
What are you talking about?

402
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:59,503
One second,
everything was normal.

403
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:01,972
All of a sudden,
you stopped responding.

404
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,441
It was like you shut down.

405
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,910
I had to say something.

406
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,449
It's unfortunate
what both your country

407
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:13,117
and the company
have been through

408
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,887
in the last several weeks.

409
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,756
Yes.

410
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:22,159
A succession
of unfortunate events.

411
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,829
The timing of which
almost seems intentional.

412
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:27,798
Well, at least there's
good news for both of us.

413
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,668
Your little pet project

414
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:33,771
came through even better
than you thought.

415
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:36,574
I must admit, she surprised me.

416
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:39,910
It's a good thing that she did
the right thing in the end.

417
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,213
It's too bad.

418
00:24:42,215 --> 00:24:43,914
You know, for all she's done,

419
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:45,683
it won't matter.

420
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,618
The failure of the bailout
has left me in

421
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,186
a rather obsequious position.

422
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:51,789
We failed our financial
stress test,

423
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,257
so we won't be able

424
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,960
to keep up all our facilities.

425
00:25:00,032 --> 00:25:03,167
As of noon this Friday,

426
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,070
I'm sorry to say,
the Washington Township plant

427
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,005
will be taken over

428
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:11,108
by the federal government.

429
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,644
[scoffs]
And here I thought we were

430
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,779
taking a step forward,

431
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:19,550
but here we stand
two steps back.

432
00:25:19,552 --> 00:25:22,953
Your actions remind me
of your predecessor, Phillip.

433
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:26,290
And here comes
the veiled death threat.

434
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,192
[chuckles]

435
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,529
You wanna take a shot at me?

436
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:33,964
Be my guest.

437
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:36,133
The appointment of a new CEO

438
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:38,269
isn't going to stop
the federal government

439
00:25:38,271 --> 00:25:40,271
from taking over the plant.

440
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:46,310
I flew for 13 hours
and 35 minutes.

441
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:50,047
If you have a point, it's time.

442
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:52,850
I needed that bailout money,

443
00:25:52,852 --> 00:25:54,184
and I no longer have it,

444
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:57,254
thanks to your little shootout
in China.

445
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,690
What do I need now?

446
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,959
Cash.

447
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,228
Lots of it.

448
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,565
I could see a scenario
where the Chinese government,

449
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,266
in a bid to establish itself

450
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:12,736
as the new global leader
of the 21st century,

451
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:15,639
loans E Corp
the money it needs...

452
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:21,145
At a low interest rate.

453
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:24,114
Perhaps even zero.

454
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:27,651
As a gesture of goodwill
to the American people.

455
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,020
With that cash,
I could save your plant

456
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,690
from the clutches
of the federal government,

457
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,091
and finally,

458
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:37,828
when a peaceful China
appears benevolent,

459
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,631
well... [chuckles]

460
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:42,199
That's an easier pitch

461
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:45,869
for me to get onto
the president's desk.

462
00:26:47,173 --> 00:26:49,607
I will be happy
to go back and talk

463
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:50,908
with the Chinese government.

464
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,978
I'm sure that they
will be most agreeable,

465
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,779
but the next time
you threaten my plant...

466
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,815
What?

467
00:26:57,817 --> 00:27:01,652
What?

468
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:05,022
The only move left in that
scenario is a third World War.

469
00:27:05,024 --> 00:27:08,292
You see? I'm a mercenary.

470
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:10,194
I don't play fair.

471
00:27:10,196 --> 00:27:13,297
I play what I want.

472
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:14,832
When you deal with a mercenary,

473
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,034
then all decorum
gets tossed out the window,

474
00:27:17,036 --> 00:27:19,370
so you go ahead
with your cute threats

475
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:21,739
and your watch beeps.

476
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,641
Order

477
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:26,076
will not protect you anymore,
my friend.

478
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:30,280
I will rain chaos,

479
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:34,284
even if it hurts me,

480
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:37,021
'cause I would rather
see you lose

481
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:39,990
than win myself.

482
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:46,397
[quietly] Oh.

483
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,033

about Stage 2.

What?

517
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:13,417
Even if they don't
tell me anything,

518
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,819
at least it'll get them
talking about it,

519

right now.

I mean, you don't stop.
I'm not doing it, man.

These guys won't think twice
about killing you on the spot.

Trust me.

526
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,905
I have a way to get him talking.

527
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:37,141
Fuck yeah.
I would love to meet him.

528
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:40,043
No, he's not meeting you.
He's meeting Mr. Robot.

529
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,415
What'd you say?

00:29:48,187 --> 00:29:49,787
[quietly] Nothing.

531

00:29:52,825 --> 00:29:54,525
Me. He's meeting me.

00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,865
We can't do this.

00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:42,472
What's the next course of action
in a case like this?

543
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:45,509
Uh, well, this definitely
falls under what we call

Or are you based in New Jersey?

- That fsociety video.

We cleaned the place good.
No, I left it.

659
00:38:42,454 --> 00:38:43,653
It's not here.

660
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,855
We wiped the whole house down.

661
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:47,624

662
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:50,927

remembering this now?

667
00:38:58,437 --> 00:38:59,936
It doesn't matter. I have to go.

668
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:02,906
Fucking hell, Darlene. I swear.

669
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:05,575
Why are you even using VHS tapes
in the first place?

670
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,976
Because it's cool?

671

Be careful coming back here.

698
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:39,035

I had this dream,

00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:30,213

is pretty rare.

719
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:32,916
It was good at first.

720
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,584
Exciting.

00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:38,021
There was this beautiful woman.

But then, man,
did it go downhill fast.

724
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:49,165
By the end,
I was being choked underwater.

725
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:04,047
Ollie Parker told me
about the CD at Allsafe.

726
00:43:04,049 --> 00:43:06,249
It was literally the first thing
out of his mouth

727
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,052

two months ago.

728

It's clear you're freaking out
about something.

I don't know how
any of this ties together,

733

but...

734
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,369
eventually someone
will connect the dots,

735
00:43:26,371 --> 00:43:28,371
and it'll catch up to you.

736
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:34,243
So I'm being real
with you right now.

737
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:37,647
Next person's not gonna
offer you food.

738
00:43:37,649 --> 00:43:39,015
They're gonna grab you
off the street

739
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:40,783
and throw you in a dark cell.

740
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:51,728
But you still have
one hand to play.

I stopped fighting it,

so much...

<i>and she said that I could have
whatever I wanted.</i>

447
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:51,595

453
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,507
I definitely remember thinking

454

455
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:08,179

457
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:14,518
And then we got to her house,
and she showed me my room,

458
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,954
and it had one of those beds

459
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,124

460
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,460

461

<i>I remember thinking that
this was my new home</i>

462

466

that this wasn't all a dream,

467
00:24:38,811 --> 00:24:41,245
and I wasn't just gonna wake up
in my old bed.

469
00:24:43,249 --> 00:24:45,115

the next morning,

470

I was still there.

471
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,654

472

479
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,776
I still wonder what my life
would've been like

480
00:25:12,778 --> 00:25:16,647

481
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,782

00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:48,065
He was waiting here?

00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,733
- Yeah, they were...
- They?

611
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:51,268
Who was he with? Male or female?

612
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,603
Dom, we're reviewing
the security footage.

613
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,039
- Let her finish.
- A woman.

614
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:58,075
His girlfriend, I think.

615
00:32:58,077 --> 00:32:59,609
They were waiting here.

616
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:01,545
They were really concerned
about their friend.

617
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:03,380
They waited for about an hour,

618
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,749
and then I told them we were
sending him up for some tests.

619
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,417
And that's when they left?

620
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:10,187
I'm sorry,
I wasn't paying attention.

621
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:13,090
If it helps, I told them
to come back in an hour.

622
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:17,094
At this point, they're
definitely not coming back here.

623
00:33:17,096 --> 00:33:19,196
He probably saw the BOLO.

624
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:21,298
He's freaking out.
Probably hiding.

625
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,001

We'll come up with something.

every loan, every transaction,

298
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:05,450
which means we can start
making new assets,

299
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,719

rebuilding the banking sector

I've been here for hours.

415
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,221
I wanted to confirm

416

a waste of my time.

- Oh, honey.

My time is much more valuable
than yours.

419
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,766
Speaking of, I've only allotted

420
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,868
28 minutes
for this conversation,

421
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,103

422
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:55,706

429
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:25,969
You've been here
close to four hours,

430
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:28,205

with possibilities

439
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,067

Such potential they bring
to our minds.

441
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,873
And yet a lock

442

Why were you testing me?

457
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,062
I know you have
sensitive information,

458
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,365
and I don't want you
to release it.

459
00:30:03,202 --> 00:30:06,503
Normally, my associates
would have murdered you by now.

460
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,539
In fact, by my calculations,

461
00:30:08,541 --> 00:30:11,975
you should have been dead
90 days ago.

462
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:16,313
But somehow, you stuck around
long past your expiration.

That is why I wanted to meet.

470

He's ruining our partnership,

473
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:53,016
and somehow it seems
that you're the motivation.

474
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:58,188
It's true, we have an event
and a friend in common.

But I haven't been fully able
to understand

477
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:05,996
What event?

478
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,497
It's no coincidence

479
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,901
that you and Mr. Alderson
became who you are

480
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,103
after what happened with
the Washington Township plant

481
00:31:13,105 --> 00:31:14,638
so many years ago.

482
00:31:20,946 --> 00:31:24,214
What does this have to do
with Elliot?

00:31:24,216 --> 00:31:26,450
Do you know him?

484
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,954
If I told you that your mother

485
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:32,389
and Elliot's father...
[watch beeps]

486
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:34,925
Died for a reason,
would it make a difference?

487

That they were a trade,

488
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:38,495
a sacrifice
for the greater good,

489
00:31:38,497 --> 00:31:40,597
that they gave their lives
to take humanity

490
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:42,399
to the next level.

491
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:46,036
And you are both who you are
today because of that event.

492
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:47,537
You would be a different person.

493
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:49,973
You wouldn't be sitting
in front of me right here.

494

You are at the intersection
of all of it.

495
00:31:55,214 --> 00:31:59,182
So I'm not going to kill you.

why you need
to drop this mission

00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:07,624

How easy a quicksand of time
people let that become.

to shut down my project.

I've got to say,

212
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,971
this one got me the wettest.

213
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:21,005
[thud]

214
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,528
So... I'm waiting.

215
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,066
What?

216
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,338
The phone calls...

217
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,773
the gifts.

218
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,243
Make me understand.

219
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:04,449
I bet you feel all
high and mighty right now.

220
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,085
That right?

221
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:10,455
Do you think you're
a powerful man, Scott?

222
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,159
Do you feel powerful?

223
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,528
[slurring] I am the CTO

224
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,129
of the largest conglomerate...

225
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,066
I'm not interested
in your job title.

226
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:25,036
I want to understand

227
00:13:25,038 --> 00:13:29,307
what would make a powerful man
like you...

228
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,043
risk everything...

229
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:34,579
all so he could drive me crazy?

230
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,222
What does it matter?

231
00:13:55,135 --> 00:13:57,235
The morning I learned that I was

232
00:13:57,237 --> 00:14:00,171
promoted to CTO,

233
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,607
I get the call.

234
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,243
Price wanted to hold
an event that night

235
00:14:05,245 --> 00:14:08,112
to announce my position.

236
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:10,081
I thought,

237
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,851
"I couldn't be any happier."

238
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:18,623
And then Sharon walked in.

239
00:14:18,625 --> 00:14:20,024
She had made a...

240
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:24,929
a doctor's visit...

241
00:14:24,931 --> 00:14:27,098
and wanted me to go with her.

242
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,068
She had found out a month ago

243
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,103
she was pregnant.

244
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,946
Didn't talk.

245
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,916
I didn't know if she was...

246
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,318
happy or sad...

247
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,921
or if I was happy or sad.

248
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,494
But when we first
saw that sonogram...

249
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,499
We lit up.

250
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:06,938
I thought, uh... [weepy laugh]

251
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,308
This is gonna end up being
the best day of my life.

252
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:16,281
[crying]

253
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:22,587
[clears throat]

254
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:28,092
After the funeral,
I didn't know why...

255
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,961
I couldn't understand

256
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:34,132
how I could...
gain and lose everything...

257
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:40,038
In one fell swoop.

258
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,081
I wanted you to feel
what I felt.

259
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,718
I wanted to give you hope

260
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,154
that I could step on!

261
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,097
[sobbing] But I'm sorry.

262
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,072
[sobbing]

263
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:41,199
Ohh...

264
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,135
You pussy.

265
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,737
You piece of shit.

266
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:49,140
I hope you rot in hell
like your wife.

267
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:51,142
You're mourning a woman who,
after she found out

268
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:54,045
she was pregnant, was gonna
fuck my husband's brains out.

269
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:55,747
I'm glad she's dead.

270
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:57,415
Fuck her and her fetus corpse.

271
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,018

but the doctors say
he's gonna recover.

296
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,484
The bad news is,
he's gonna be arrested

297
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:10,455
and put away for a long time
for his stunt in D.C.

298
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,790
God.

299
00:18:12,792 --> 00:18:16,561
Politicians love to teabag

Too bad
they can't take the heat.

301

was domestic terrorism

303
00:18:22,102 --> 00:18:23,334

00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:31,175

the ringleader of their outfit.

00:18:34,747 --> 00:18:38,282
I am no leader.

I can barely keep a guy.

309
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,194
Look, Darlene.

310
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,733
I don't really care
what happened in D.C.

311
00:18:55,735 --> 00:18:58,870
In fact, I thought
it was kind of funny.

312
00:18:58,872 --> 00:19:02,206
I've never seen Congress move
as fast as they did on that day.

313
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:06,744
But there are serious holes
in your story.

314
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:09,647
And I want to work with you
to figure out why.

315
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,925

316
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,860

We're just two crazy,
wacky Jersey girls.

322
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,209

323
00:19:38,211 --> 00:19:41,746
what probably was
the love of my life.

324
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,516
And you act like you care.

325
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,451
But that's just it...

326
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:50,955
An act.

327
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,958
Which is sick and twisted.

328
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,528
I'd rather you arrest me
and throw me into jail.

329
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:01,232
But let's get
something straight.

330
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:04,635
You will not get
anything out of me.

331
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:08,306
So why don't you go
read your manual

332
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:10,608
and find the chapter
on conniving cunts

333
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,610
that don't give a fuck
about you or your feelings

334
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,812
and then get back to me
with some real tactics?

335
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:16,814
Otherwise, get me a lawyer.

336
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,283
As far as I'm concerned,

337
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,852
my only statement to you
is that I saw my boyfriend

338
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:25,289
go brainless last night
at dinner.

339
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,425
I ordered the breakfast combo,

340
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,594
and he stole some of my bacon.

341
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,998
If you want any other details,

342
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,234
the answer is suck a dick.

343
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:46,677

It's not really scary, but gory.

351
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,845
You know how those two things
aren't really the same?

352
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,517
This is the stuff we found
from Cisco's place.

353
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:28,352
Couldn't find any tapes.

354
00:21:28,354 --> 00:21:30,554
Figured you were smart enough
to destroy them.

355
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:33,724
We're running fingerprints
and DNA.

356
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,327
Soon we're gonna figure out
if those fsociety videos

357
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,297
were filmed using this camera.

358
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,399
If we find your DNA
on that stuff...

359
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,803
I don't know...

360
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,705
you tell me how that looks.

361
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:52,977
As far as your fsociety
videos are concerned,

362
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,313
it looks like the one person
that can help you

363
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:57,481
is fucking dead.

364
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:59,083
As far as I'm concerned,

365
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:02,720
Cisco and I were into filming
some freaky shit.

366
00:22:02,722 --> 00:22:06,357
Is that a matter of
national security too, hon?

367
00:22:11,964 --> 00:22:13,864
Then there's this.

368
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:18,502
Remember your buddy,
Xander Jones?

369
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:21,038
According to him, you guys
had a sexual relationship.

370
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:24,942
[scoffs] Dude,
are you just gonna

371
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:27,578

372
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,380
Is that really all you got?

373
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:31,949
He also said that you were
the one that stole his gun.

374
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,352
Well, I can't prove that,
obviously,

375
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,088
because your fingerprints
weren't on his safe.

376
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,558
I figured you'd be crafty enough
to clean up afterward.

377
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:45,062
What is funny, though,

378
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:48,532

to the Fun Society arcade.

Within the next month,

00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:52,756
they'll have
all the paper documents here.

00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,125
I thought we were gonna have to
deal with multiple facilities,

416
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,995
but they're making it easier
for us by moving it all to one.

00:25:14,514 --> 00:25:16,080
What malware?

426
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,082
Oh, you orchestrated it

00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,818
When you hacked Evil Corp,

439
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,888
you gave us access
to the backdoor.

440
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,157
You made it possible

then you can do one
thing for me.

466
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:09,193
What? Anything. Say the word.

467
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,332
You remember the night we met

468
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,968
at the E Corp party?

469
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,804
Yeah.

470
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,272
You were tending
the bar that night.

471
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:26,010
You stayed late to clean up.

472
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,045
Yeah, that's what
we always do after the...

473
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:29,980
Then you saw Scott

474
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:33,684
coming down from the stairwell
leading to the roof.

475
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:38,322
He was disheveled,
out of breath, sweaty.

476
00:27:39,925 --> 00:27:44,161
You were about to ask him
if he needed anything,

477
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:49,266
but he was in such a hurry,
he left without saying a word.

478
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:50,801
What are you talking about?

479
00:27:50,803 --> 00:27:53,070
I didn't see anything like that.

480
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:56,974
Yes, you did.

481
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:59,410
No.

482
00:27:59,412 --> 00:28:02,446
I remember because the cops
were asking every one of us

483
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:06,183
questions about that night,
and like I told them...

484
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,252
Cleaned up my station,
and I went home.

485
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:11,088
Derek, you said you were
serious about punishing him.

00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,757
[laughs] Yeah, but Joanna...

487
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,160
Look at my face, Derek.

488
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,828
You want the man
that did this to me

489
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,963
to do what he did
and get away with it?

490
00:28:19,965 --> 00:28:21,165
But Joanna, I...

491
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:23,734
Once you tell the cops
your story,

492
00:28:23,736 --> 00:28:26,370
they're gonna ask you why
you're just now confessing

493
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,139
after months of silence.

494
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:32,476
You're gonna tell them
that you were scared...

495
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:36,180
that Scott Knowles
intimidated you.

496
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:38,215
That when Tyrell went missing,

497
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:42,419
you didn't think any of that
mattered anymore.

498
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,089
But your conscience
got the better of you.

499
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:52,396
This is how we win.

500
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,832
This is how we punish him.

501
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,102
You understand?

502
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:03,841
Thank you.

503
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:08,212
Thank you for protecting me.

504
00:29:13,886 --> 00:29:16,320
Of course, babe. I love you.

505
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:26,497
Now, let's go over it again.

506
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,300
- We can't do this.
- You want us to stay on target?

507
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:34,238
This is the target.
This gets us to the top.

508
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,173
I know we've been operating
under top secret

509
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:38,225
on this program, but I think
it's worth the risk.

510
00:29:38,226 --> 00:29:40,276
This girl's being a wise-ass.

511
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,179
She thinks
she's smarter than we are.

512
00:29:42,181 --> 00:29:45,149
That's because so far
she has been.

513
00:29:45,151 --> 00:29:47,317
We got to show her
we're smarter.

514
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,153
Unless she thinks we're worthy,

515
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:51,488
none of this is gonna fly.

516
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:53,457
Just trying to sidestep
the mines, like you said.

517
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,559
We've been building
this plan for three months.

518
00:29:55,561 --> 00:29:57,928
Look around you.

519
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,564
All our leads are getting
killed and disappearing.

520
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:03,167
We've lost three suspects.

521
00:30:03,169 --> 00:30:05,469
Dark Army's cleaning house.

522
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,972
So that must mean something
is about to go down.

523
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:10,808
Our window is closing.

524
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,843
Every lead we've been
following up to this point

525
00:30:12,845 --> 00:30:14,945
has led to a dead end.

526
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:18,048
Yeah, I'm gonna bring
the ADIC in on this.

527
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:20,918
Please, you're gonna let him
try and flip her?

528
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,320
She's gonna shut down.

529
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,888
I'm right for this.

530
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,357
Then I'm gonna go in with you.

531
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,095
Let me do it alone.

532
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,568
I know her.

533
00:30:39,905 --> 00:30:41,572
I am her.

534
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,878
And if we're doing this,

535
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,447
we're doing this now.

539
00:31:15,174 --> 00:31:17,107
It's the hardest case
I've ever worked on

540
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:20,978
and probably the hardest one
I ever will.

541
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,179
Swear to God, the only reason

542
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,381
why I think I've
gotten this far...

543
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,121
Is because I have no life.

544
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,223
[small laugh]

545
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:36,894
It's the only thing I've
been able to think about.

546
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,162
Now I'm sitting here with you...

547
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,000
In this awful room.

548
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:49,139
And no matter what story gets
written in the final analysis,

549
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:52,109
we've both been a part

550
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:57,114

But neither you nor I

553
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:05,355
are special.

554
00:32:05,357 --> 00:32:07,991
I've already learned
that lesson.

555
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:19,970
If you're open
to changing your mind,

556
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:22,306
I'd like to show you something.

Don't let anyone near him.

I'm here now.

get out of line

that everything we experience,

00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:57,084

that Mr. Alderson's father

used to work for us
on this project?

of course.

203
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:02,983
In fact, it was his
great engineering work

00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,018
that led to some of our
early successes.

205
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,789

coincidence.

00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,659

00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,606

impassioned plea
to destroy E Corp

214
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:30,277

with the opportunity

215
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,946
to set our plan in motion,
and it has taken

216
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,248
his relentless determination
since

217
00:08:35,282 --> 00:08:36,784
to continue it.

218
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:40,020
We may possess
the necessary tools,

220
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:46,293

when we needed him.

Therefore,

I only recognized one of them.

- Who?

276
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,469
- Tyrell Wellick.

277

- Shit.
 It was real.

278
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,407
It actually happened.

279
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,842
The gun.

280
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,077
- Slow down.

281
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,211
You've been shot.

my power is gone too.

285
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,485
- I just did
what they told me to do.

I was scared.

287
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,521
- Angela...

288
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,957
you have to tell me
how I got here.

289
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:07,094
- I was on my way
to turn myself in to the FBI,

290
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:10,097
and I was stopped
by the Dark Army.

291
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,765
They sent a man
to my apartment.

292
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,767
Elliot, you can't get up.

293
00:12:13,801 --> 00:12:16,236
- I have to warn the police.

294
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:19,539

anything,

- I need to find him.
- Who?

309
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,433
- Tyrell.

310
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,301
- Are you crazy?
He shot you.

Evil Corp's recovery facility.

- I have to stop them.

- How can you be so sure
that that's what they're doing?

314

You've been unconscious
for the past six days.

Hey.

Let your visitor know

348
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:26,726
I got plenty of
vacant apartments.

349
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,996
We got to get
some of these things rented,

350

or else we're all
going to get screwed.

That's why I upgraded
the facade.

You know. It used to be
this ugly red.

353

Now it's this chrome.
I think it's very inviting.

We have to go.

gunshots went off.

00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,121
The slowest three seconds
of my life.

The FBI even questioned me.

So yeah, it's not safe
for me anywhere.

384
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:09,496
In fact, everywhere for me
is pretty much fucked.

This is what you meant
by "finishing off Evil Corp."

They'd have no chance

00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,348
Reverse-engineering
 protocol exploitation,

460
00:21:21,381 --> 00:21:22,915
forensics.

461
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,352
The entire city's
 suffering an energy crisis

462
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:28,855
while they're here, exercising
 their inner anarchy.

463
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:30,490
It's times like these
 I really wish

464
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:31,791
I had a mute button for life.

465
00:21:31,824 --> 00:21:34,394
- Whoo! Whoo!

466
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:36,763
[world becomes silent]

467
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:42,835
Isn't that better?

468
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:45,004
- We're fucked.
All the machines are taken.

469
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,539
They're in the middle
of the final round

470
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,475
of the qualifier
for a CTF.

471
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:49,942
It's them versus
nine other countries,

472
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,110
and from the scoreboard,

473
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,846
the Koreans are ride or die.

474
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,616
It's going to take forever
before this is over.

475
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,718
- Or I could just
win it for them.

476
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:01,721
[cheering]

477
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:08,795
*

478
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,764
They let you save
and load your game,

479
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,466
restoring all the mines
you found

480
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,967
and all the shells you cleared.

481
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16,569
That's the weakness.

482
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:18,571
The game trusts
whatever data you give it

483
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:20,006
to recreate the board.

484
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,674
Poison the data.

485
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:23,109
You can make it run
whatever code you want.

486
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:25,445
- Yeah.
We already thought about that.

487
00:22:25,478 --> 00:22:26,913
It won't work.
There's a server-side key

488
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,715
used to verify the game saves.

489
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,016
- And without it,
you just get a checksum error,

490
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:31,484
which is why you play the game

491
00:22:31,518 --> 00:22:33,085
until you find the mines first.

492
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,689
Once you know the full board,
you can derive the key.

493
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,725
And you already spotted
the code injection vuln

494
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:42,562
in the save handler function,
right?

495
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:44,397
- Shit.
I never thought of that.

496
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:46,399
- Dude, just let him on.

497
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:47,900
- No way, man.

498
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:50,603
Need I remind you,
I was a CyberPatriot finalist.

499
00:22:50,637 --> 00:22:52,605
- Yeah, in middle school.

500
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:54,607
If we don't make the top three,
we're not going to Vegas.

501
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,009
And he knows this shit
better than you.

502
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,679
- Fuck it, I've been at this
for four fucking hours.

503
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,448
I gotta deuce it out anyway.

504
00:23:01,481 --> 00:23:03,049
This Soylent ain't
for the faint-hearted.

508
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,029
- I see them.
Stay calm.

509
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:21,133
It's Dark Army.
It's me they want, not you.

510
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,835
You having an attack?

511
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,771
- It's okay.

512
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:27,406
Don't stop, okay?
I'll be fine.

513

You need to help me.

521
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,199
There's Dark Army everywhere.

522
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,135
I saw them.
They have guns.

523
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,237
Please.

524
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,238
[knocking on door]

525
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:33,840
Shit.

[people cheering]

527
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:50,557
- Dude!

528
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,124
Dude, I can't believe
it only took you

529
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,660
two minutes to win
the final round.

530
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:55,127
- Can you please
take your hand off me

531
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,295
and leave me alone?

532
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,930
- Yeah.
Dude, I--I was just--

533
00:24:57,964 --> 00:24:59,065
- Thank you.

[keys clacking]

536
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,775
The backdoor had
 a hard-coded C2 domain

537
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:11,010
pointing to a listener
 on Tyrell's machine.

538
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:14,113
All I have to do
 is hack the registrar

539
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,982
and change
 the name server configs.

540
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:18,718
*

541
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,153
Once I hijack the domain,

542
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:26,025
I can shut down their access
 before the Dark Army notices.

543
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,126
- Elliot.

544
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,561
- I'm almost done.

545
00:25:28,595 --> 00:25:29,696
I shut the backdoor.

546
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:30,763
I just have to uninstall--

Do it.

This is them.

Get in.

- No, you're not.

Should be on the floor
right below you there.

00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,137
Pull up the motor vehicle
lookup tool, would you?

570
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:46,172
Sorry...

571
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,840
about the mess.

572
00:26:47,874 --> 00:26:49,241
Been a while
since I had time to clean it.

But hey, gas prices
what they are right now,

574
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,980
taxis are a premium,

you're welcome
for the free cab ride.

Uh, now, Elliot,
do me a favor, would you?

577

Read her the license plate

Uh, now, miss.

Yeah, I'm gonna pursue
for about ten minutes.

Yeah, I have line of sight
of the vehicle.

Okay. VIN number,

Did they get that from me?

Or did I get it from them?

However it happened,

it's clearly
 a Dark Army front now.

This must be the guy

627

 that fucking menu.

629
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:57,136
Go get us a couple

630
00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,006
On me.
Oh.

631
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,842

they punch my card.

Now, the faster
we get that rolling,

636

the faster you two can leave.

637
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,320

00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,295
- What about my punch card?

642
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,197
- And don't call me "miss."

643
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:31,270
- Well, she's full of life,
huh?

645
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:36,375

this is about.

00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:38,210
- Well...
[sighs]

647
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:41,213
We hear you've been
running around town.

648
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:43,883
The doc says
you should be resting.

649
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,184
- I had shit to do.

650
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,819
- Well, you want to
catch me up

651
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:49,355
on where we're at?

652
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:50,556
- I shut the backdoor.

654
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:56,195
- Now, why would you
go do a thing like that?

655
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:59,531

this operation off.

We've gone to great lengths--

659
00:30:07,439 --> 00:30:10,509
- It's not negotiable.

660
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:12,444
And if there's a problem
with my request,

661
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,181
you can deal with me.

662
00:30:15,214 --> 00:30:17,583
And only me.

will be disappointed.

She believes that a plan

669
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:39,338
lives or dies
by its creator, so...

if you want it dead,

671
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,909

674
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,982
And they canceled
the Mets game,

675
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:52,084
so I'll probably end up
working on my book a little.

676

- That's it.

we took out of you?

put it right back in.

697
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,302
if they wanted to stop us.

698
00:32:16,335 --> 00:32:17,636
That tends to be their response

699
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,572
when they disagree with you.

700
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:22,208
- And who are "they," exactly?

701
00:32:22,241 --> 00:32:25,144
Is this just Dark Army, or

702
00:32:25,177 --> 00:32:29,348
is Tyrell Wellick
involved in all of this, too?

703

I know a lot more
than you think, Elliot.

704

Answer the question.

705
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,356
Is Tyrell Wellick involved?

706
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:38,991
Has he been a part
of this whole thing

707
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:41,994
from the beginning?

708
00:32:42,028 --> 00:32:45,064
- No.

Look, even if they were lying,

710
00:32:47,533 --> 00:32:50,469
I closed their only access.

715

is that we survive this thing.

716
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,015
We got out alive,

717
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:05,217
which happens to be
a luxury right now.

We don't know where Trenton
and Mobley are,

719

but they're probably dead.

720

I can't trust them.

This was too easy.

But at least I stopped them
 for now.

in the sand?

Encrypting Evil Corp's data

Turned it into a fist
that punched us in the dick.

And like a botnet,
the fear I created

it's practically airborne.

1012
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:20,565
*

1013
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:23,601
* Tell me what you see

1014
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:25,470
* I need something more

1015

[muffled, faraway voice]

1016
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:31,076
- We reestablish access
that tunnels us right back in

1017
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:32,410
Evil Corp's internal network.

1022
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,686
* Tell me what you see

1023
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,354
- I got to ask,

1024
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:47,525
what is in this for you?
Why are you doing this?

1025
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:50,428
- Like I told you before,

1026
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:53,698
I'm not going to talk to you
like I talk to Elliot.

1027

1028
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:59,971
You and I,
we are not friends.

1029
00:49:00,005 --> 00:49:03,241
- It's precisely
that you're besties with him

1030
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,742
that I'm trying to understand

1031
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:07,678
how you can lie to him
so blatantly.

1032
00:49:07,712 --> 00:49:11,416
- How could I be lying to him?

1033
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:15,153
I'm literally looking
right at him.

1034
00:49:18,423 --> 00:49:21,192
- That's certainly
a creative way

1035
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:23,094
to get out of this.

1036
00:49:23,128 --> 00:49:24,996
But let's be real.

1037
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:28,099
You are taking advantage
of Elliot's...

1038
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:32,570
let's call it
"unique" condition.

1039
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:37,108
- He started this,
didn't he?

1040
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:39,710
I'm just helping him
finish it.

1041
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,713
*

1042
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:47,152
I'm pushing him along.

1043
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,420
Isn't that what you do?

1044
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:53,558
*

1045
00:49:53,591 --> 00:49:57,028
- That is what I do.

1046
00:49:57,062 --> 00:49:59,064
If you want me
to keep on doing

1047
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:01,132
what it is that I do,

1048
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:03,501
we're going to have to
trust each other.

1049
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,503
Right now, Angela,

1050
00:50:05,536 --> 00:50:09,240
I do not trust you.

1051
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:13,111
So I'm going to ask you
one more time.

1052
00:50:13,144 --> 00:50:16,114
Why, exactly,
are you doing all of this?

1053
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:23,321
*

1054
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:26,524
- Evil Corp killed my mom.

1055
00:50:26,557 --> 00:50:33,331
*

1056
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:36,401
And my whole life...

*

1058
00:50:40,438 --> 00:50:45,676
I've always wanted justice
for her death.

1059

*

1060
00:50:51,316 --> 00:50:54,419
But how do you bring justice

1061
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:58,589
to a conglomerate
as untouchable as Evil Corp?

1062
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:05,563
*

1063
00:51:06,697 --> 00:51:10,168
I thought I would never win.

*

1065
00:51:13,204 --> 00:51:15,506
Even after I found out
about your crazy plan,

1066
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,676
I still didn't believe
it was possible.

1067
00:51:18,709 --> 00:51:26,083
*

1068
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:33,458
Not until I met Whiterose.

*

1070
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:43,468
It wasn't until
she opened my eyes

1071
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:46,337
that I could see how

1072
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:49,640
all of the damage
that they've caused...

1073
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:51,342
*

1074
00:51:51,376 --> 00:51:56,514
Could finally be...undone.

1075

*

1076
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,656
When we succeed...

1077
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:10,228
*

1078
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,930
A whole new world
will be born.

- They're planning something.

- 17 of 71 facilities

- Elliot, what is Stage 2?

6

- The femtocell was to
get access to their UPS's.

They're trying to blow up
Evil Corp's recovery building.

You don't have any rights.

That much I thought,
but what I didn't realize was

59
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,060
maybe they're a necessary evil

60
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,310
that just needs to be
kept in check.

61
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,345
In fact,
maybe calling them evil

62
00:02:20,346 --> 00:02:23,540
was just my dorm room

We're happy to have you here.

But since I'm working
on the recovery team,

I can help them
rebuild the database

100
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,435
- Our current plan
is deeply flawed

101
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:51,630
and massively inefficient.

102
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,860
This is William.

103
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,770
He's my technology manager.

104
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,140
If I can convince him
to convince his boss

105
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,575
to convince his boss
to convince her boss

106
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:01,640
to digitize all
the paper records

107
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,000
in their local facilities

108
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:05,115
instead of shipping them here,
then...

109
00:04:05,116 --> 00:04:07,340
We can avoid
a single point of failure.

110
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,885
We would install
hardware and softw--

111
00:04:08,886 --> 00:04:10,580
- Elliot,
I hear your passion,

112
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,780
but I got tickets to the
Goo Goo Dolls reunion concert

113
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,230
tonight, so let's wrap this up.
Okay? [clicks tongue]

114
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,950
-* Right now *

115
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,595
- His password was pretty easy
to figure out after that.

116
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:21,320
After going through
his emails,

117
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,900
I quickly learned that
he was having the engineers

118
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,900
install rootkits on
all of Evil Corp's phones,

119
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,870
so they can illegally sell
private consumer data.

120
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,580
- * New sensation *
[knocking on door]

121
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,140
- I tipped off the FBI,

122
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,840
got him arrested,
and promptly set a meeting

123
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,770
with the next exec
up the chain.

124
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,450

* You're only human *

130
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,890
- But meetings can take
forever to set.

131
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,660
So in the meantime,
I had to look for a stopgap.

132
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,520
In this case, E Shipping,

133
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,400
their shipping management
console.

[truck horn blares]

135
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,505
- Wait a minute,
this ain't right.

136
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:02,800
All our shipments
are supposed to go to New York.

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,370
- The paper says
"Sioux Falls, South Dakota."

138
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,370
- Yeah, you're in Sioux Falls,
Earl,

139
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,580
which sure as shit
don't make no sense.

140
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,780
But all right.
Unpack her, boys!

141
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,610
- I'm sending shipping
requests

142
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,255
to the actual facilities,

143
00:05:19,256 --> 00:05:21,420
but in the manifest,
I'm making it look like

144
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,380
all the paper's still
arriving in New York.

145
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,060
It'll take a while, but
I just need to buy enough time

146
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,670
until I can prove my case
to upper management.

147
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,990
- * Uh-huh *

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,500

* New sensation *

151
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,940
- By eliminating
physical paper delivery,

152
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,710
we can cut E Shipping cost,

153
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,845
installing hardware
and software at--

154
00:05:42,846 --> 00:05:45,870
- Elliot, you are ambitious,
I'll give you that,

155
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,020
but I got a SoulCycle class
I'm late for.

156
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,950
Let's pick this up
sometime next quarter?

157
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,950

I felt bad taking him down,

160
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,765
until I saw that
he had his engineering team

161
00:06:01,766 --> 00:06:03,830
use special software
to help E Corp's

162
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,190
auto manufacturing partners
cheat the emissions test

163

they really created.

-* A new sensation *

165
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:15,000
- Factoring in the bureaucracy
and the line of

166
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,780
corrupt, moronic managers
I have to get through,

167
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,450
I'll need to keep up
the illusion that

168
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,050
shipments are still happening.

169
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:24,020
- These are the same damn boxes
you brought last week.

170
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:27,390
- You know me.
I do what the paper says.

171
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,620
- All right!

172
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,320
Pack it up, boys!

173
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,820
- Problem with my illusion is,

174
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,495
what if Tyrell
and the Dark Army

175
00:06:34,496 --> 00:06:36,420
think all the records
actually get there?

176
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:39,670
This is why I gotta keep
the UPS systems safe too,

177
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,430
because these innocuous
backup batteries

178
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,930
in the New York facility

179
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,775
can turn into idle bombs
with the right malware.

180
00:06:46,776 --> 00:06:48,740
And these are
the frontline soldiers

181
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,300
trusted to protect them.

182
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,915
- You guys gonna stop me?
Uh, I'm a bloodhound, girl.

183

I just dove right back in,
dude, just--ah.

184
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,950
- This patch ensures
that the UPS devices

185
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,680
will only run trusted code

186
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,090
that's digitally signed
by Evil Corp.

187
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,995
Bottom line:
even if they think

188
00:07:03,996 --> 00:07:05,890
all the paper records
got here,

189
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:07,990
they won't be able
to blow up that building.

digitizing locally

and not shipping
paper records here

197
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,210

for our recovery efforts.

exactly?

been facing charges

for murdering his wife,
Sharon Knowles.

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,445
Initially, your husband,
Tyrell Wellick,

353
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,170
was accused of the murder,

354
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,685
until you claimed Scott Knowles

355
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:51,780
confessed to killing his wife
while beating you.

00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:54,450
And since then, a bartender
from the night of the party

357
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,380

to corroborate your story.

more about what happened?

- My lawyers have advised me
not to speak to that.

But what I can say, Frank,
is that

363
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,370
I didn't need Scott Knowles
to be arrested to know

364
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:15,640
that my husband is innocent.

367

claim you filed for divorce.

00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,930

a few months ago.

It was a moment of weakness.

that was the right thing to do.

19 of the 20 members

the Five/Nine Economic Accord,

making Ecoin the currency

by which all others
will be measured.

The only obstacle

640
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,910
is the illegitimate
monetary imposter

641
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,740

unofficially adopted...

China is weakening
our economic state

646
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,680
by not signing this accord,

647
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,030
and the fact
that they have embraced Bitcoin

648
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:57,230
shows their resistance

649
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,300
and emphatic rejection

650
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,670

Truthfully, the only reason
I even agreed to meet

661
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,530
was that this room
happens to be on my way out--

662
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,970
- Have your government
sign the goddamn accord!

U.N. vote to annex the Congo,
it's as good as yours,

666

must end.

The rest of the world needs
China to embrace Ecoin now.

We're at risk of
other countries pulling out.

as simply as I can,

so that we never have to
belabor this point again.

I don't give a fuck

Until I get my U.N. vote,

677
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:23,180
don't waste my time.

678
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180

the administration
changes its mind

680
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,860

that there's something
I never shared with you.

My associates found
your pet employee

I can see why you like her.

She makes
a very good companion.

And those eyes of hers--

00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,170
I contemplated firing a bullet
into each of them,

693
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,270

It's early.

I was looking for a pen.

To write you a note.

I have to catch my bus.

What's with the interrogation?

from this.

166

- And I told you to leave.

167
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:52,866
We clearly have
communication issues.

168
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,234
- Let's go.
You're coming with me.

169
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,036
We have to talk.
- Not gonna happen.

170
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,071

some extra hardware

173

wired to my monitor's
display controller

are you hacking me?

178
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,600
- Take another step,
and I will fucking scream.

179
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,036

It's me.

187
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,861
- Yeah, well, that's
a pretty complicated statement

we don't do that to each other.

199
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:39,106
- You wouldn't talk to me.

when I'm here.

in the moisture.

Here, look.

Layman's version--
two tablespoons dry rub

to one cup apple cider vinegar,

215
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:26,053
maybe beer, depends.

216
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,856
Then use a brush
to mop the ribs

217
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,224
during the cooking process.
Delicious.

218

- Today's Friday.

- It was a figure of speech.

228

Point is I received
official word--

we go on September 29th,
ten days from now.

Now, you know how the boss
feels about timetables.

231
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:12,332
You said you can manage
those two knuckleheads,

232
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,401

a lot of faith in you.

233

I'm assuming you can
make this happen.

234
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,072
- What about
the shipping delays?

- Well, good thing we have
our guy on the inside, huh?

236
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,313
Help speed things up.

237
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:30,050
- Of course.

238
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,853
We'll make it happen.

239
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:34,287

We've prepared

You think it was even possible
to cook 'em as deliciously

262
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:45,525
I mean, who knows
if this is even real meat?

00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:48,095
As tasty as they are,
I wouldn't be surprised

265

- No, it was me.

271
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,452
I had to do a deep search,

272
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:17,124
make sure no one was listening.

273
00:14:17,157 --> 00:14:18,458
You were right.

It's all right here
in my research.

You could've taken all of this,
sent it in as an anonymous tip,

284

that finds them.

00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,454
I need to see where this leads.

292

This is not who you are.

You don't hurt people.

to stop this.

to that place.

and with what you have,

to stay awake and keep watch

you turn into Mr. Hyde

They didn't though.

They saved him, Mr. Robot.

And now he's trying to wage
 a terrorist attack,

I could've tipped off the FBI,
 given them all this evidence

That was a terrible lie.

There's no way

You're still coming

a little lonely in p-town.

Don't waste these years
behind bars.

Tyrell Wellick,
is he your leader?

Boys in Gitmo find
your type especially cute.

Mr. Nouri, when I get bored,

and this silent treatment
of yours

443
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,678
is a straight-up sedative.

444
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,015
So this is the last time
I'm gonna ask you,

445
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:33,019
and, I urge you this time,
do not bore me.

446
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,724

What's with
the Armani Exchange getup?

453
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,887

00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:14,761
You sure you can stay up?

457
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:18,631
- Just did an eight ball,
so I'm golden.

458
00:23:18,665 --> 00:23:21,634
- Maybe we should have
some sort of signal

459
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:22,669
when I'm coming and going

460
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:25,872
so you know it's me.

461
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:29,208
- How about you just tell me?

462
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,579
- That's a good signal.

463
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:36,449
Good night.
- Wait, are you going to sleep?

464
00:23:36,483 --> 00:23:38,851
- I was gonna
walk Flipper first.

465
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,720
- Cool, I'll come with.

466
00:23:43,122 --> 00:23:45,892
Okay, so,
just thinking out loud,

467
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:52,098
but, if I do follow him
and find Tyrell

468
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:56,569
and the Dark Army
and shit goes down,

469
00:23:56,603 --> 00:24:01,440
like, bad shit,
you'd get vengeance, right?

470
00:24:04,076 --> 00:24:06,713
Like, if I die or something,
you'll kill whoever did it,

471
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:09,582
and, obviously,
I'll do the same for you.

472
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:13,520
Like, like a vengeance pact.

473
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:14,854
- Is that even a thing?

474
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:20,159
- It can be our thing.

You in?

I'm sorry.

480
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:43,716
I treated you like shit
for weeks.

481
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,653
I shouldn't have been
pushing you away.

right to that asshole's
apartment.

488
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:12,144
We got more than half the FBI
across the country

489
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:15,682
chasing Tyrell Wellick,
and you're asking that yahoo

490

about the mythical Whiterose
from the land

Groups like these
don't have leaders.

495

- The Dark Army isn't like
any other group.

496
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,230
And I'm tired of being
the only one that questions

497
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,165
their involvement in this.

498
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,868
- No doubt they're involved,
but this video is fsociety

499
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,771
to the bone, and ever since
we picked up our guy,

500
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:41,240
fsociety chatter
is off the charts.

501
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,075
Makes sense if they're planning
to make good on their threat,

502
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,277
and we just snagged
one of their operatives.

503
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:49,248

handed us his location.

00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,944
Elliot's been rerouting
 the shipments

528
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,212
all over the country.

529
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,348
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

530
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:13,319
[clattering]

531
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,454
[panting]

532
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:17,957
Why am I even surprised?

533
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,758
I told you this would happen.

534
00:29:22,862 --> 00:29:24,030
You know him.

535
00:29:24,063 --> 00:29:25,464
You know he can't be trusted.

536
00:29:25,497 --> 00:29:27,099
He's behind
the shipping delays.

537
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:28,534
This is explains everything.

538
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:30,837
This manifest was
a fucking mirage.

539
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:33,806
[crashing]

540

*

541
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,012
And on top of that,
you've agreed

542
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,480
to a new timeline?

543
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,816
- That was before I knew
about all of this.

544
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,485
I came here
to talk about our options.

545
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:50,122
- Options?
We have no fucking options!

546
00:29:50,156 --> 00:29:51,991
What happened
to your perfect plan?

547
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:53,993
You placed him at E Corp
to speed up the consolidation,

548
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,594
not to stop it.

549
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,463
We're worse off
than where we started.

550
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,098
Why did you even let him
work there in the first place?

551
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:00,466
- It was the best way
to manage him.

552
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:05,004
This doesn't change anything.

553
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,839
This can still be salvaged.

554
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:09,375
- This is all your fault.

555
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,277
No, it's all his fault.

556
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:14,881
The Dark Army needs to know
what he's done.

557
00:30:14,914 --> 00:30:17,449
- You know that
you can't tell them.

558
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,387
You understand
the consequences.

559
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,490
And not just for Elliot,
for all of us.

560
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:27,326
- Well, maybe I can reason
with them.

561
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,495
- Never appeal
to a man's better nature.

562
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:32,198
He may not have one.

563
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,633
- This isn't impossible.

564
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,869
We arrange to have
the western-most states

565
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:38,337
ship their records by plane.

566
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,239
Our trucks will handle
the East Coast.

567
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,540
We just need to stay focused.

568
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:43,375
- Everyone will notice
the trucks.

569
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,077
It will draw too much
attention.

570
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:46,478
- If we move the paper
over the weekend,

571
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:49,648
we can operate under the radar.

572
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:54,153
In the meantime, I'll have
Elliot's access revoked

573
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:56,155
to make sure that he doesn't
interfere again.

574
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,057
- What?

575
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,660
You can promise
this motherfucker

576
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,997
won't stop us again when he
wakes up in the morning?

577
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,566
- You can talk to me.

578
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:13,572
*

579
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,376
- Okay.

580
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:19,545
Face it, Elliot,
if that's who

581
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:21,914
I'm even talking to.

582
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:24,383
We work nights together
for over six weeks to prepare

583
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,652
this project,
but you spend your days

584
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:28,587
ruining all we've accomplished.

585
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,522
You, as a person,
make no sense.

586
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:31,657
You're a liability.

587
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,926
- Our goal hasn't changed.

588
00:31:35,962 --> 00:31:38,397
- I can't follow
this back-and-forth anymore.

589
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,666
You had one simple directive--

590
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,669
to maintain control
until the plan was executed.

591
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,238
- It doesn't work that way.
There's no on/off switch.

592
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:48,640
- Then tell me,
how does it work?

593
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:49,942
'Cause I don't even know
which Elliot

594
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:51,277
I'm talking to right now.

595
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:54,947
- How it works
is I am here now.

596
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57,283
Don't forget whose operation
this is.

598
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,721
- I once thought you
to be a god.

599
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:05,291
I loved you.

600
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,995
But now I see how foolish I was
and how inferior you are.

601
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:11,030
Like a fucking cockroach.

602
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,698
You messed up
for the last time.

603
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:14,366
I'm taking over.
So, no.

604
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,202
This is no longer
your operation.

605
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,738
This is mine.
[grunting]

606
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,074
- Listen to me,
you Swedish scumfuck.

607
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:23,542
This is my revolution.

608
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,212
I am the architect.
Do you understand?

609
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:29,181
The only reason you are here is
because I allowed you to be.

610
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:32,551
Don't forget I could've
pulled that trigger twice.

you might have a development,

Yeah, I'm still butthurt

tired of being a traitor.

Maybe I just wanna be
a normal person

buy me...

the social thing.

Darlene, I get
this is tough for you.

710
00:37:02,988 --> 00:37:05,557
We've got a lot of intel
that says something

711
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:08,026
is happening and soon.

712
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:11,763
From the looks of it,
it could be big.

713
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:15,467
We need to get Tyrell
before it's too late,

714
00:37:15,501 --> 00:37:18,970
which means you need to tell me
if you know something.

716
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:24,876

but I need to go at it alone

717
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,346
without a wire.
- That's not gonna happen.

718
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,481
- Well, tough titties,
it's the only way

719
00:37:29,515 --> 00:37:30,649
I'm doing this,

720
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:33,885
because, when I do this,

721
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:37,423
and you're all popping Cristal
after you land Tyrell,

722
00:37:37,456 --> 00:37:39,425
understand something--

723
00:37:39,458 --> 00:37:42,328
it's game over for me.

724
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:48,434

but I'm gonna lose my brother.

This needs to happen by Monday.

728
00:37:56,642 --> 00:37:57,943
- But I can't work
with him anymore.

729
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,044
Elliot is dead to me.

730
00:37:59,077 --> 00:38:00,045
Our partnership is over.

731
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:03,048

from 71 buildings

across the country to New York
over this weekend?

734
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,755
It would draw
too much attention.

735
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,324
- That sounds like a YP,
not an MP.

736
00:38:12,358 --> 00:38:13,825
I don't know what to tell you.

737
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,827
Whiterose is strict
about her schedule.

738
00:38:15,861 --> 00:38:17,496
- Be reasonable.

739
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,365
I'm back at the beginning.

740
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:20,832
Give me more time.

741
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,034
- As I said, has to happen
on Monday.

742
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,403
- Why the change in deadline?

743
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,837
You knew there were delays.

744
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,340
This mad rush isn't worth
the risk.

745
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,641
- You keep squawking
as if I'm gonna give you

746
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,477
a different answer.

747
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,780
Look, you get this done,
we all take a nice vacation.

748
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:38,750
I've been looking for some time

749

to finish my book.

750
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:42,554
I lost my partner.

751
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:45,957
We were supposed to be
gods together, but it's over.

Tyrell, I get that you
and Elliot are having

754
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,739
interpersonal issues.

755
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:05,043
Sometimes coworkers find

756
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:10,015
that they aren't the right fit,
but they still gotta finish

757
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:13,919
the job, you know?

758
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,455
Besides, you and I both
know this has nothing

759
00:39:16,488 --> 00:39:19,791
to do with Elliot being a god.

760
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:23,729
If he is no longer with you,
if he cannot finish the job,

761
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:27,165
well, that proves one thing.

762
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,402
You are the god, not him.

763
00:39:31,537 --> 00:39:35,140
And I am damn confident
that you will find a solution

764
00:39:35,173 --> 00:39:38,844
to our timing issue.

765
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,581
You were destined for this,
Tyrell.

This is your moment.

767
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:48,954
This is the moment
you were born for.

772
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,168
There is a way.

773
00:40:05,671 --> 00:40:09,875
First, the baby monitor.

774
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,510
I haven't been able
to connect in weeks.

775
00:40:11,543 --> 00:40:13,679
They must've set up
a new system.

776
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:19,050
Regardless, I want to see them
in person instead.

777
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,120
My wife, my son, and I

778
00:40:22,153 --> 00:40:25,791
will go
to the Ukraine, together,

779
00:40:25,824 --> 00:40:28,927
on Monday
after the plan is complete.

780
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:32,464
They don't extradite
to the U.S.

781
00:40:32,498 --> 00:40:35,200
I want your word.

782
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:36,835

Do me a favor and
check on Joanna.

787
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:48,580
I've been reading online,
and it seems

788
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,148
she's been maintaining
a low profile.

789
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:54,786
Make sure she's okay and
inform her of the plan.

790

- And Irving?

792
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,262
There's one last thing I need
in order to execute.

793
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,531

- Your message said
this was urgent.

- I'm coming to you because
I don't have just cause

00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:22,080
for this request,

800
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:25,551
but I need it
 to happen quickly.

Elliot Alderson.

803
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,156
Ban him from any and all

- And why do you want me
to fire him?

806
00:41:39,565 --> 00:41:41,266
- I have my reasons.

807
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:43,769
Explaining them won't help,
but my discretion on them

808

- And you're comfortable
making this decision?

- Mr. Price, I know
this random employee

811
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,914
doesn't matter to you.
He's just a number.

812

You can continue to question me
because you seek

813

my true reasons,
or you can deny my request

814
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,088
because I'm overreaching.

815
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,090
But I'll return the favor.

You know I'm good for it.

817
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:09,928
If you want my reasons,
 I'll have to restate

818

what I said.

819
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,332
They are mine,
and my discretion on them

820
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,801
is important.

821
00:42:18,136 --> 00:42:20,839

what happened?

834

00:43:18,163 --> 00:43:20,098

staying here this weekend.

Can't have any more accidents.

842
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,719
He saw you and Tyrell.

843
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:42,353
- He only saw us
for a few seconds.

844
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:45,290
Maybe he won't remember.

845
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:49,728

I'll handle it.

- I told you this would happen.

849
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:02,373
I told you that he would
find a way to stop us.

00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:08,967
* Everything means nothing
 to me *

886
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,337
* Everything means
 nothing to me *

887
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:19,410

1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:03,137
Anything we do,
he will try to slow us down.

2
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:05,773
As long as he exists,
he will stop us.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:08,309
Today is the day
I start working at Evil Corp.

4
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,419
I can help them
rebuild the database

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:11,779
and defend the fort
at the same time.

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,348
This patch ensures
that the UPS devices

7
00:00:14,382 --> 00:00:16,450
will only run trusted code.

8
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:19,420
Bottom line, they won't be
able to blow up that building.

9
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:22,323
U.N. vote to annex the Congo,
it's as good as yours,

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,658
but this currency war must end.

11
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,462
Stage 2, I want it to happen
on the day of the U.N. vote.

12
00:00:28,496 --> 00:00:30,136
Protesters have
surrounded the building.

13
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:33,067
Summon as much NYPD
as is necessary.

14
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,611
You know that telling Elliot
anything about this

15
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:36,470
would violate the terms
of your immunity?

16
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,772
I think I have a lead,
but I need to go at it alone.

17
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:42,476
I may have immunity,
but I'm gonna lose my brother.

18
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,079
- Stage 2 was never called off.
- How do we find them

19
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:46,456
and just end this
once and for all?

20
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,716
The best lead we've got is me.

21
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,752
Irving, he says
we'll be ready to go on Monday.

22
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:54,188
We've prepared for
an emergency evacuation.

23
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,556
We have?

24
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:57,225
I'll have Elliot's
access revoked.

25
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:58,535
I need you to fire
Elliot Alderson.

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,693
Consider it done.

27
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:01,762
You okay?

28
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,532
- What's happening?
- Angela, why is he here?

29
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,400
Everything's gonna be okay.

30
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,336
Elliot saw everything.
I had to knock him out.

31
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,703
You're staying here
this weekend.

32
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,239
We can't have anymore accidents.

33
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,706
He's gonna wake up again.

34
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,742
He only saw us
for a few seconds.

35
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,410
Maybe he won't remember.

36
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:50,444
Aller Anfang ist schwer.

37
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:57,285
Anfang ist anfang.

38
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,889
One, two, three four

39
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,624
One, two, three,
four, five, six

40
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,761
One, two, three, four

41
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:10,231
Five, six, seven, eight

42
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,737
To relay to
the Syrian President.

43
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:19,373
But Putin's stance
is that it would be a mistake

44
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:21,942
to abandon
the current government.

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,745
Meanwhile, the U.N. Security
Council has gathered today

46
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,714
for a much talked about vote,

47
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:30,351
the People's Republic of
China's proposed annexation

48
00:02:30,384 --> 00:02:33,354
of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.

49
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,356
As the world awaits
the result of the vote,

50
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,425
many questions are being raised:

51
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,393
What does it mean...

52
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:40,737
For the relationships
between world superpowers

53
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,730
and impoverished nations?

54
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,637
One, two, three, four

55
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,739
Five, six, seven, eight

56
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:54,508
Elliot?

57
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:00,781
Isn't that your phone?

58
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,453
Is it?

59
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:08,456
Are you okay?

60
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:09,990
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:14,962
Hello?

62
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,273
Finally, I've been trying
to reach you all weekend.

63
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,332
Are you at work?

64
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:20,668
- Yeah.
- Don't go anywhere.

65
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,936
We need to talk, in person.

66
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:25,373
Meet me downstairs.
I'll be there in ten.

67
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:28,876
Okay? It's... it's important.

68
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:31,211
Is everything okay?

69
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:36,450
Everything's fine.

70
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:43,291
Hey...

71
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:45,259
we should grab lunch later.

72
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:05,579
Something isn't right.

73
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:07,715
Like something
slipped away from me.

74
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,350
What is it?

75
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,420
I can't put my finger on it.

76
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,988
What am I even doing here?

77
00:04:15,022 --> 00:04:19,360
I'm arriving at work.
I'm walking toward my cubicle.

78
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,562
I'm just on autopilot,

79
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,398
running my routine.

80
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:27,801
Did my daily program crash?

81
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,737
When code runs,
it should run straight through

82
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,605
without interruption,

83
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,843
until all of its tasks
have been completed.

84
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,911
Unless something goes wrong.

85
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,581
A runtime error.

86
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:44,718
Sometimes, corrupted memory
can lead to one.

87
00:04:44,752 --> 00:04:46,920
Is that what's happening
to me right now?

88
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:49,022
A runtime error?

89
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,427
Yo, what up, E?

90
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:55,663
I barely made it past
those protesters this morning.

91
00:04:55,696 --> 00:04:57,698
I mean, the natives
are getting restless.

92
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,334
This shit's crazy AF, right?

93
00:05:00,368 --> 00:05:01,835
Is it?

94
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:03,737
Hey, so I had
a piece of tang this weekend

95
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,606
you are not gonna believe, dude.

96
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,775
I was unlocking achievements
Saturday night

97
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,077
that went all the way through
to Sunday morning.

98
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,347
I even impressed myself.

99
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,015
Every morning starts like this,

100
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,950
graphic sex talk.

101
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,787
Thankfully, I'm able
to tune most of it out.

102
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,891
When people talk like this,
they're either insecure,

103
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:27,461
or they're full of shame.

104
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,497
Which one do you think it is?

105
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,034
I...

106
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,836
Sorry.

107
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:40,508
Shit. That was meant for you.

108
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,610
I'm really off today.

109
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,014
I mean...

110
00:05:47,047 --> 00:05:49,550
Jesus, Elliot, I, um...

111
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,653
You know what, man? Fuck you.

112
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,688
I'm just trying to
brighten up your day

113
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:56,666
with my dopeass anecdotes,
but if you don't appreciate it,

114
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,692
I can just sit here in silence.

115
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:00,861
Really?

116
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:03,697
Is this gonna end up being
a beautiful accident?

117
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,733
No... no, I'm...

118
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:08,469
I'm sorry, bro.
I shouldn't have said that.

119
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:10,003
Spoke too soon.

120
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,139
I'm bigger than this, man,
and, in a way,

121
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:13,974
what you just said
actually helps me,

122
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,909
'cause I've always wondered

123
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,121
if people here thought I was
just trying to get attention,

124
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,847
but I was like, "Nah."

125
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,482
But I should've
started the day off

126
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,484
by asking what you did
this weekend.

127
00:06:23,517 --> 00:06:25,519
He does raise a good question.

128
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,488
What did I do this weekend?

129
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,624
Instead I'm always just
rambling around some bullshit.

130
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:33,461
But you know what, I'm gonna
drop some truth on you, dude.

131
00:06:33,494 --> 00:06:36,163
Since we're opening up here, I...

132
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:39,467
I've only ever
gotten laid twice.

133
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,134
Okay, actually,
it was 1 1/2 times,

134
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,036
but the first time, it was...

135
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,114
It was one of those highend
escorts, dude, a courtesan.

136
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:47,775
I saw her at the Plaza Hotel...
And actually, she saw me, dude.

137
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,610
She totally was hitting on me.

138
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,612
It cost me, like,
two weeks' pay.

139
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,881
I know what I did this weekend.

140
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,849
I rehearsed my proposal.

141
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,751
I have a big meeting with
the VP of Technology.

142
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,463
I've actually never had
penetration, dude.

143
00:06:59,487 --> 00:07:01,221
I've never penetrated.
I just... I...

144
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,056
I went to one of
those rub and tugs...

145
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,826
No, wait,
I already had that meeting.

146
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,528
That was last week.

147
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,162
What happened this past weekend?

148
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,840
I just kept thinking
she was one of those girls

149
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,566
that got kidnapped
and was forced to do it.

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,480
I was, like, thinking of
her family the whole...

151
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,005
Hey, dude, thanks for
letting me confide in you.

152
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,008
Just don't tell any of
the guys about this. Cool?

153
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:22,876
It's hard what he just did...

154
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,778
- Yeah...
- Opening up facetoface,

155
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,915
which is why
I probably talk to you.

156
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,065
Why is my account locked out?

157
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,177
E Corp Help Desk.

158
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,712
Hey, I got locked
out of my account.

159
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,280
Can you do
a password reset for me?

160
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,915
Can I have your employee number?

161
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,717
072391.

162
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,218
Please hold.

163
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:13,961
My work email is
prompting me for a password.

164
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,663
Did someone try
to get on the domain

165
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,030
as me too many times?

166
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,866
Or has E Corp locked me out?

167
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,768
Did they discover
my shipping hack?

168
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,636
I need to check
my monitoring server.

169
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,671
Hey, Samar...

170
00:08:23,704 --> 00:08:25,973
Samar, I got locked out.

171
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,084
Can I hop on your machine
to check something real quick?

172
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,277
Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure,
go for it.

173
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,946
Yeah...

174
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,916
Is this that bad feeling
I have looming over me?

175
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,318
Is this why today
doesn't feel right?

176
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,856
An update failure.

177
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,992
No, this can't be happening.

178
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,862
Maybe something's wrong
with my dashboard.

179
00:08:48,896 --> 00:08:50,964
I need to check the full log.

180
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,142
Shit. This morning at 6:07 a.m.,

181
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,245
the Dark Army
tried to run Stage 2.

182
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,015
My patch stopped them,
but it doesn't change the fact

183
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,618
they're trying to blow up
the downtown building today.

184
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14,021
Damn, dude, Bobbi from HR
is rolling up with Security.

185
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,889
Wonder who they're axing.

186
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,661
Mr. Alderson,
thank you for waiting.

187
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:23,030
I looked into this.
It looks like we cannot

188
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,932
restore your account
at this time.

189
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:27,768
Is there anything else I can...

190
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,238
Samar is right.
HR is firing someone.

191
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,340
Me. Fuck...

192
00:09:33,373 --> 00:09:35,843
I can't leave the building
until I get back on a machine

193
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,086
and figure out
how they're planning on

194
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,912
getting around my patch.

195
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,981
Samar, I need you
to distract them for me.

196
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,249
Wait, what?

197
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,884
Help me figure this out.

198
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,286
Do not leave me. Stay focused.

199
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,906
Excuse me,
I had a question for you...

200
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,083
We're looking for
Elliot Alderson.

201
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,709
Do you know where he is?

202
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,210
Yeah, yeah, he's on floor 11.

203
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:12,079
You know, they have
the best bathrooms,

204
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,823
and he likes to take his
morning dump around this time.

205
00:10:13,847 --> 00:10:15,749
Samar, you need to
be serious right now.

206
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:17,393
We have talked about these
microaggressions of yours.

207
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,019
I am being serious.

208
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,063
He told me he was crowning
his whole commute.

209
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,321
He was just here.

210
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,990
We need eyes on Elliot Alderson.

211
00:10:23,023 --> 00:10:24,725
Elliot, I didn't know
if you'd be here.

212
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,335
- Janet, I...
- Great news on your proposal.

213
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,037
Starting with
the Southwest region this week,

214
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,863
all paper records
will be digitized locally.

215
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:31,999
I tried to find you on Friday.
I... you weren't in.

216
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,234
I wanted to congratulate you
in person.

217
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,703
Before we know it,
the database...

218
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:37,204
Did you hear what she said?

219
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,807
I wasn't in Friday. Where was I?

220
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,076
When did my program halt?
Why can't I remember? Wait...

221
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,713
- Mr. Robot...
- Mr. what?

222
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,080
What day is it today?

223
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,949
You know it's gonna be
a long week

224
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,226
if you gotta ask on a Monday.
Is everything all right?

225
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,719
Janet, I can't talk right now.

226
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,754
There's an I.T. emergency on 29.

227
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,025
Last thing I remember
was the E Corp party.

228
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,860
That was four days ago.

229
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,262
Did Mr. Robot really
take over for that long?

230
00:11:04,431 --> 00:11:06,399
Don't look up. Security cameras.

231
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,403
That's right. Darlene.
I remember now.

232
00:11:10,437 --> 00:11:12,773
She was supposed
to follow me... him.

233
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,207
You know what I fucking mean.

234
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,043
She must've seen Mr. Robot.

235
00:11:16,076 --> 00:11:17,911
Darlene...
I can barely hear you.

236
00:11:17,945 --> 00:11:19,279
It's a madhouse down here.

237
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,448
You were gone all weekend.

238
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,359
You left Flipper alone. I had
to give him to your landlord.

239
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,152
Listen to me. Did you follow me?

240
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,855
Did you see him?
Okay, just come downstairs.

241
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29,398
I'm getting fired.
I can't leave until I've...

242
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,224
Ma'am. Check the stairway.

243
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:34,194
Elliot? Elli...

244
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:37,264
I'm going to get him.

245
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,368
All I know is it's been
six fucking weeks,

246
00:11:41,401 --> 00:11:43,436
and I haven't had
a weekend with my son.

247
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:46,874
I did trade the car.

248
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,076
I'm taking the subway. So what?

249
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,778
I'm picking him up
from school today.

250
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,412
They cut my access privileges.

251
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,413
I completely disagree.
I think he definitely loves me.

252
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:56,416
Sir... Sir...

253
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:01,989
Are you gonna really
get into that right now?

254
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:04,858
That was one time
I told him I hated him.

255
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:11,331
I'm going to attract attention.

256
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,267
I have to remain calm.

257
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,937
Take deep breaths.

258
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,839
Be cool.

259
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,307
Don't panic.

260
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,943
Slow everything way down.

261
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,314
Blend in.

262
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,383
Look bored, broken.

263
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,787
Get a blank office stare
on my face.

264
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:36,924
This is how they do it,
isn't it?

265
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:38,167
How they're able
to watch the world

266
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:40,861
fall apart around them?

267
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:44,564
Because to them, this is normal.

268
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,067
It's all they know.

269
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,137
Maybe I can learn from them.

270
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:53,140
I wish I could see myself
through your eyes.

271
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,909
Don't you wish you could
see yourself through mine?

272
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:58,111
As we step through our code,
line by line,

273
00:12:58,145 --> 00:13:01,281
debugging it to find the cause
of our runtime error.

274
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,950
What am I doing?

275
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,284
I'm still attracting attention.

276
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:05,986
I'll still get caught,

277
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:07,821
and it'll be
painfully slow to watch.

278
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,323
This isn't gonna work.

279
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:13,460
We need to find an open space,
a network jack.

280
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,234
God damn it, it's the start
of the work week.

281
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,070
Monday morning attendance:

282
00:13:23,103 --> 00:13:24,547
All of the conference rooms
are booked,

283
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:28,075
and all of the cubicles
are full.

284
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,979
I'll have to get someone
off their work station.

285
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,313
Here...

286
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:37,484
She's the perfect candidate.

287
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:49,396
Hi, Edie, I'm Henry from I.T.

288
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:51,564
- Hello.
- We've detected you using

289
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:54,134
some unauthorized
remote access software

290
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,904
to connect to your computer
work station from home.

291
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,406
My. That can't be true.

292
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:02,109
Don't worry, I'm just gonna
take a look at your machine

293
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:04,344
and perform an assessment
to make sure you don't have

294
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,047
an unauthorized desktop
sharing service installed.

295
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,016
Well, I'm gonna
have to contest that.

296
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:10,517
I've hardened my install

297
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,519
further than the standard
configuration,

298
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:16,023
including a restrictive
host base firewall rule set,

299
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:19,192
and whitelisting to block
unauthorized apps from running.

300
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:21,094
I might've chosen
the wrong candidate.

301
00:14:21,128 --> 00:14:23,997
I think I know your culprit,
though.

302
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:28,001
Fred over there
uses GoToMyPC all the time.

303
00:14:28,035 --> 00:14:29,903
Let me introduce you.

304
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:39,646
Fred...

305
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:45,352
You loused it up again.

306
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,954
Hi, Fred.

307
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,256
Henry from I.T. Are you serious?

308
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,466
You gotta take a look
at my machine now?

309
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,092
I just got in.

310
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,369
Listen, I just need it
for 15 minutes.

311
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:55,028
I'm... I'm backlogged here, man.

312
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,064
I got my supervisors
giving me deadlines.

313
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:59,466
This isn't a matter of debate.

314
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:05,505
Whatever.
I'll be in the break room.

315
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:25,158
Log data from the Dark
Army's backdoored machine.

316
00:15:29,696 --> 00:15:32,399
They're using this guy's
account: Frank Bowman.

317
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:35,068
He's a member of the code
signing architecture team.

318
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,170
This is what they're doing.

319
00:15:37,204 --> 00:15:39,315
They wanna sign their own
firmware and bypass my patch.

320
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,974
If they do that, they'll blow up

321
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:42,248
the downtown recovery building.

322
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,311
My only chance to stop it

323
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:46,980
is to get to the hardware
security modules, the HSMs.

324
00:15:47,014 --> 00:15:49,116
They're on the 23rd floor.

325
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,233
No, I haven't seen him.

326
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,383
Did he just come in?

327
00:16:37,364 --> 00:16:39,199
Hi. How are you?

328
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:41,401
One sec, I'm just
finishing up an email.

329
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,588
I think that
you're in the wrong...

330
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,582
Almost finished.

331
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,251
All right...

332
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:01,621
Excuse me, very important memo.

333
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:03,790
We should get started.

334
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:05,792
I think you're in
the wrong room.

335
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:08,595
I'm sorry, you are?

336
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:12,432
- Sean, head of Sales.
- Sean. Of course.

337
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,833
Dave Kennedy.

338
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,536
I work with Craig
on the Q4 push.

339
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,106
I had longer hair then.

340
00:17:19,139 --> 00:17:21,608
Listen, we're on a deadline.
We don't have time for this.

341
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,443
You are in the wrong room.

342
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,212
Well, maybe there's been
some confusion,

343
00:17:25,245 --> 00:17:26,646
either on your end or mine.

344
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,082
What room did you say this was?

345
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,322
You know, I think
that's my room.

346
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,358
No.

347
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,161
All right,
let me check my calendar.

348
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:44,464
Service has been
spotty all morning.

349
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,199
All right, here it is.

350
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,302
You're right, so embarrassing.

351
00:17:49,336 --> 00:17:51,638
I'm not supposed
to be on 44, 12C.

352
00:17:51,671 --> 00:17:53,706
Yeah, I'm down one floor,

353
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,356
I should've known.

354
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,158
We always have
chocolate donuts too.

355
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,725
Jesus Christ,

356
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,694
you have wasted
enough of our time already.

357
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,429
We need to get started.

358
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,270
You know, Sean,

359
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:26,839
sometimes I get a lot like you,

360
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:29,842
where you have a lot of anxiety,

361
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,445
because of a deadline,

362
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:36,149
you know, where you feel
pressure, because...

363
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:38,418
something has to get done.

364
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,653
And then,
all of these damn little

365
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,556
unknown variables
keep popping up.

366
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,833
And when you find yourself

367
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,903
at the center of
one of those storms,

368
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,739
man, you just gotta breathe.

369
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,610
Just let go.

370
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,379
Get it done.

371
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,725
Mr. Alderson!

372
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:21,628
Mr. Alderson!

373
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:24,797
Hey, stop!

374
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,567
Mr. Alderson, stop!

375
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,635
St...

376
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,505
Shit,
I'm going through the lobby.

377
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,274
Security will force me out.

378
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:36,476
What should I do?
What would you do?

379
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,211
That's right,
you never answer me.

380
00:19:38,245 --> 00:19:39,912
Is this why I created Mr. Robot?

381
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,981
To help me get out of
situations like this?

382
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,816
At least he interacts with me.

383
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,685
If Mr. Robot was here,
what would he do?

384
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,263
First thing he'd tell you
is to stop talking

385
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:48,488
to your imaginary friend.

386
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,922
You're not really him, though.

387
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:51,324
Would you stop trying to be

388
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:52,892
so technical about everything?

389
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,494
You know if he were here,

390
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,938
he'd tell you
exactly what he told you

391
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,530
when he said
to walk away from Vera.

392
00:19:57,564 --> 00:19:59,332
This is a zerosum game.
Accept the truth.

393
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:01,000
That building
is going to blow up,

394
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,545
and there's not a damn thing
you can do to stop it.

395
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:04,737
I'll find a way
to destroy the HSMs.

396
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,373
Once I do that,
there'll be no way

397
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,940
for the Dark Army
to run Stage 2.

398
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,642
How are you gonna do that?

399
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:10,686
You're about to be
kicked out, Einstein.

400
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,379
So the real question is,

401
00:20:12,412 --> 00:20:14,314
can you get to the HSMs
before they do?

402
00:20:14,347 --> 00:20:16,349
All I need to do is get
to the ground floor.

403
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,026
Once I'm there,
I'll find a way to get back in.

404
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,919
With the security they have?

405
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,721
I'll tailgate someone.

406
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,566
Hate to see it, kiddo,
but you'd have better luck

407
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,468
tailgating the parking lot
at a YoYo Ma concert.

408
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,394
They got all their peepers
peeled for you.

409
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,662
- I know my way around.
- Even if you do get up there,

410
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:32,499
you got Bobbi and her
Keystone Cops looking for you.

411
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,267
You'll never get away with that.

412
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:35,844
And while you're busy
spinning your wheels,

413
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,704
trying to prove
that piece of wisdom wrong,

414
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,506
the recovery building's
going to explode,

415
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,741
and the people inside
right along with it.

416
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,610
He's right.
I need to worry about

417
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:47,013
the people in the building,
not the HSMs.

418
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,815
But there is no he.

419
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,551
That was just my imagination.

420
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,520
We haven't seen
each other in months.

421
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,289
We've been battling each other
in our own voids.

422
00:20:56,323 --> 00:20:58,725
But at least now
I know my next move.

423
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,971
This is what
democracy looks like!

424
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,606
Elliot Alderson,
we've been instructed

425
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,608
to escort you off the premises.

426
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:17,344
Show me what
democracy looks like!

427
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,945
This is what
democracy looks like!

428
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,780
Show me what
democracy looks like!

429
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:22,615
This is what
democracy looks like!

430
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:24,517
Show me what
democracy looks like!

431
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,419
This is what
democracy looks like!

432
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:28,321
Show me what
democracy looks like!

433
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:31,023
This is what
democracy looks like!

434
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,726
E Corp Recovery Center.

435
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,895
How may I direct your call?
Listen, there's gonna be

436
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,764
a buildup of hydrogen
in the data center.

437
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,532
Sir, I'm having
trouble hearing you.

438
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:41,368
Would you like me to
connect you...

439
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,745
You've gotta get everyone
out of the building now.

440
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,979
A spark will ignite the hydrogen

441
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,538
and bring the whole place down.

442
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:46,749
Have someone look at
the battery room

443
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,341
for your UPS devices.

444
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:50,109
Sir, UPS?

445
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,345
We use E Shipping
for our freight services here.

446
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:53,756
Would you like me to
transfer you to the warehouse?

447
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,448
There's a fucking bomb
in your building.

448
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,450
Clear everyone out now.

449
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,819
Hopefully that gives everyone
enough time to get out.

450
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,521
Now all I need to do
is find a way to...

451
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:02,855
Elliot!

452
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,126
You've gotta help me
get back inside.

453
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,728
I have to tell you something.

454
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:10,663
There's a code signing
machine on 23.

455
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:12,817
We have to find a way to...
I'm working with the FBI.

456
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:21,007
After Cisco,
when the FBI questioned me,

457
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,775
they did more than that.

458
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:24,420
They had everything
laid out on this board:

459
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:28,481
Us, Angela, Trenton,
Mobley, everyone.

460
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,817
They had been following
our every move for months.

461
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,719
They knew everything.

462
00:22:32,752 --> 00:22:34,497
And Tyrell, they think
he's at the center of it all.

463
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:36,389
Wait... wait a minute.

464
00:22:36,423 --> 00:22:37,790
Back up.

465
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:43,396
This... this has been
going on since Cisco?

466
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:48,768
You've been working with them?
The FBI?

467
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,072
Why didn't you tell me?

468
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,141
I made a deal for us.

469
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,944
- All they want is Tyrell.
- What?

470
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,846
What deal?

471
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:05,652
Is that why you hacked me?

472
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,487
For them?

473
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,926
What's going on?

474
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,732
Are you wearing
a fucking wire right now?

475
00:23:19,766 --> 00:23:21,534
No.

476
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:24,471
No, they don't even know
that I'm here.

477
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:27,039
Elliot,
I'm telling you the truth.

478
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,942
The truth?

479
00:23:29,976 --> 00:23:33,179
The truth?

480
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:36,082
You've been working with
the FBI behind my back?

481
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,818
You've been spying on me?
Am I to blame for this?

482
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,488
Not telling her
how much I miss Mr. Robot?

483
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:43,590
How a part of me may have
let all of this happen?

484
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:45,024
The other night,

485
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:47,627
I followed you
like you asked me to.

486
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,062
He snuck out of the apartment
around 2:00 a.m.,

487
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:53,165
and met up with Angela.

488
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:56,736
She knew it was him.

489
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,614
I think the two of them
have been working with...

490
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,072
Tyrell.

491
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,908
That's it.

492
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,544
My runtime error.

493
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,780
I saw her...

494
00:24:07,814 --> 00:24:10,883
And him.

495
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:13,520
I was standing in a room...

496
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,822
and they were together.
Angela is the one behind this.

497
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:18,658
I gotta stop her.
Angela's been betraying you?

498
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,994
So have you.

499
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:26,633
You kept this from me.

500
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:33,740
You've been trying to play me
this whole fucking time?

501
00:24:33,773 --> 00:24:35,708
This is what
democracy looks like!

502
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:37,510
Show me what
democracy looks like!

503
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,211
This is what
democracy looks like!

504
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:40,980
Show me what
democracy looks like!

505
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:43,716
This is what
democracy looks like!

506
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,124
- Four, three, two, one...
- We are live.

507
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,627
This is what
democracy looks like!

508
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:55,762
Okay, we've live in five,

509
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:58,565
four, three..

510
00:24:58,598 --> 00:25:00,700
Thanks, Jack. I'm here
outside E Corp headquarters,

511
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:03,269
and while it's typical
to see daily protesters,

512
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:07,006
it's unusual for the crowd
to be this size and this vocal.

513
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,775
An NYPD official told me

514
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:10,843
they're taking the situation
very seriously,

515
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,646
and sending in additional units
for crowd control.

516
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,015
What's less clear is why today.

517
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,051
With an alltime high
unemployment rate of 26%,

518
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,721
giving many citizens
something to march about,

519
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,623
most of the protesters
I spoke with

520
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,325
did give me varying answers
as to why they're here.

521
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,027
From forced currency changes

522
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,129
to corporate greed
and corruption,

523
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,931
I even had one gentlemen tell me

524
00:25:31,964 --> 00:25:34,266
he was here to protest
this morning's U.N. vote,

525
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:38,738
that he felt it was
somehow connected to E Corp.

526
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,673
This is what
democracy looks like!

527
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:42,308
Show me what
democracy looks like!

528
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:44,276
This is what
democracy looks like!

529
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,112
Show me what
democracy looks like!

530
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,014
This is what
democracy looks like!

531
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,816
Show me what
democracy looks like!

532
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,684
This is what
democracy looks like!

533
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:53,285
Show me what
democracy looks like!

534
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,221
This is what
democracy looks like!

535
00:25:55,254 --> 00:25:57,023
Show me what
democracy looks like!

536
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:58,991
This is what
democracy looks like!

537
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:00,693
Settle down!

538
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,328
This is what
democracy looks like!

539
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,363
Everybody!

540
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,799
Settle down!

541
00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,668
Everyone!

542
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:11,303
Settle down!

543
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,673
Everyone...

544
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:44,236
Scan your badge.

545
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,138
I said scan your badge now!

546
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,018
Tensions are running high,

547
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,953
as the United Nations vote
approaches.

548
00:27:00,987 --> 00:27:03,222
While no one can predict
whether today's resolution

549
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:06,058
will pass, all five
permanent members,

550
00:27:06,092 --> 00:27:09,061
China, France,
the Russian federation,

551
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,698
the United Kingdom,
and the United States

552
00:27:11,731 --> 00:27:13,766
must be in unanimous agreement

553
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,703
for the measure to be adopted.

554
00:27:16,736 --> 00:27:18,671
One, two, three, four

555
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:22,274
One, two, three,
four, five, six

556
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,744
One, two, three, four

557
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:27,046
Five, six, seven, eight

558
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:29,348
One, two, three, four

559
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,417
One, two, three,
four, five, six

560
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:37,757
Yeah! Got it, whoo!

561
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,462
Please stay on your floor.

562
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,899
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

563
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,001
Stay away from
elevators and stereos

564
00:27:49,035 --> 00:27:52,238
until further notice.

565
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,108
This is Angela.

566
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,077
- Blankenship.
- Mentor.

567
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,179
Walk toward the elevator
bank on your floor.

568
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:02,390
There's a package waiting
for you at the reception desk.

569
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,216
Has your name it.

570
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,952
There's something going on.

571
00:28:05,985 --> 00:28:07,920
I don't think
I can leave my office.

572
00:28:07,954 --> 00:28:09,455
That's our distraction.

573
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:11,023
What do you mean
your distraction?

574
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,825
Get moving.

575
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,361
We don't have a lot of time.

576
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:17,163
This is an emergency.

577
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,265
Please stay on your floor.

578
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:22,234
- What's going on?
- Ran into a bit of a snag.

579
00:28:22,268 --> 00:28:23,970
We're gonna need you
to go ahead and have

580
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,413
Elliot implement
our contingency plan.

581
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:27,139
Elliot?

582
00:28:27,173 --> 00:28:29,141
What contingency plan?

583
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:33,279
He needs to get to
a computer called a, HSM,

584
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,081
make a backup of it.

585
00:28:35,114 --> 00:28:38,785
Once we get that,
we'll be good to go.

586
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:40,119
Come on, let's go, let's go!

587
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,821
I got the package.

588
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,455
Good.
Take the package to Elliot.

589
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,424
It contains
all the hardware he'll need.

590
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,760
He'll pose as a member of
the internal audit team

591
00:28:47,794 --> 00:28:49,896
based out of Detroit.

592
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:52,464
Everything he needs to know
is on a sheet of paper inside.

593
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,871
He'll get it done.

594
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,807
Call me when it's finished.

595
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:07,413
Attention, all E Corp employees,

596
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,548
this is an emergency.

597
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,051
Please stay on your floor.

598
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,387
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

599
00:29:15,421 --> 00:29:17,489
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells...

600
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,194
Ma'am, what are you doing here?

601
00:29:55,227 --> 00:29:57,029
It's not safe for you
to be on elevators.

602
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,564
I was, um...

603
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,933
I'm trying to get
to my office on 23.

604
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:03,235
There's a secure room
and a safe zone on 23

605
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,437
with no windows.
I'll take you there.

606
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:13,012
Okay. Thank you.

607
00:30:13,045 --> 00:30:15,915
As no permanent members of
the council voted against it.

608
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,483
The draft resolution contained

609
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,152
in document S/2015/511
hereby passes,

610
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,022
allowing annexation
of the Congo by China.

611
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:25,557
I will now open the floor to
members that wish to extend...

612
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:31,530
This is Murphy.
I'm on elevator 4.

613
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,032
We just lost power.

614
00:30:33,065 --> 00:30:35,634
I'm stuck between
floors 26 and 25.

615
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,573
Don't worry,
they'll sort it out.

616
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:44,576
We'll be fine.
What's in the package?

617
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:46,312
Hopefully
it's something we can eat.

618
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,081
We may be here a while.

619
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:51,417
Hard drives.

620
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,486
Probably not
the healthiest choice.

621
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:58,466
Here, let me help you with that.

622
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,893
No, it's okay.

623
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,495
What the heck is this?

624
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,297
It belongs to my direct report.

625
00:31:05,331 --> 00:31:07,166
He... he ran out of a meeting

626
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,101
and left his badge
in a conference room.

627
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,636
I'm bringing it back to him.

628
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:12,171
Interesting that
your direct report

629
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,206
has special access
and you don't.

630
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,949
You're gonna have to
come with me.

631
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:32,992
Attention, all E Corp employees,

632
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:35,094
this is an emergency.

633
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,429
Please stay on your floor.

634
00:31:37,463 --> 00:31:40,666
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

635
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,002
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

636
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:46,172
until further notice.

637
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:49,008
I really should,
head back to my office.

638
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,609
It's actually just
right back there.

639
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,220
No, no, no, no, no, we're
gonna straighten this out.

640
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,712
Hey! Over here!

641
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,315
Douchebag!

642
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:10,696
- Hey, over here!
- Go, go, go!

643
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:23,242
Attention, all E Corp employees.

644
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,611
This is an emergency.

645
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:28,314
Please stay on your floor.

646
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:29,715
Lock all doors,

647
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,517
and find the nearest safe zone.

648
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,519
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

649
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,287
until further notice.

650
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,458
This is the police!

651
00:32:39,491 --> 00:32:42,061
Do not attempt
to cross the line.

652
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:45,564
This is the police.

653
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:48,600
Do not attempt
to cross the line.

654
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:50,429
Where's the USB key?

655
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:15,421
Attention,
all E Corp employees...

656
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:32,771
Fuck... Come on, come on,

657
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,540
there's gotta be one
around here somewhere.

658
00:35:12,344 --> 00:35:14,146
Hey.

659
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,782
Fuck, you scared
the shit out of me.

660
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,850
Sorry.

661
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,562
Have you seen
what they're doing out there?

662
00:35:20,586 --> 00:35:22,821
- It's insane.
- Yeah, I know.

663
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,392
You okay?

664
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,427
Yeah, I am now.

665
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,198
Wait...

666
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,568
How did you get in here?

667
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,175
I'm a part of
the internal audit team,

668
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,311
out of Detroit.

669
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,912
Was in the middle of
an unannounced

670
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:48,547
physical security audit

671
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:51,417
of the code signing operation.

672
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,591
You fucking bitch!

673
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,914
Thank God.

674
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,991
Yeah...

675
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,339
Attention, all E Corp employees,

676
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:29,341
this is an emergency.

677
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,791
Attention, all E Corp employees,

678
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,793
this is an emergency.

679
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:24,095
Please stay on your floor.

680
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:27,499
Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

681
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,668
Stay away from
elevators and stairwells

682
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,037
until further notice.

683
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:34,573
Yeah!

684
00:40:14,613 --> 00:40:16,624
This great country didn't
start out with 50 states,

685
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:18,484
so why stop at 50 states?

686
00:40:18,517 --> 00:40:20,852
And, let me add,
that this is why we need a man

687
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:23,589
with a business acumen like
Donald Trump as President.

688
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,757
If China makes another move
like they did today,

689
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:28,226
our standing
as a world superpower

690
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,161
will be put into question.

691
00:40:30,195 --> 00:40:32,173
Mr. Trump has the drive,
the ambition to help us...

692
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:34,700
- Marlinspike.
- Moxie.

693
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,902
It's done, but we got a problem.

694
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,236
I was made.

695
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,805
There was a woman
in the CSAT room.

696
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:41,807
She saw me.

697
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,685
Wait, why were you in
that room instead of Elliot?

698
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,210
I couldn't find him.

699
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,912
What the hell
are you talking about?

700
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,014
Your distraction
is fucking overkill.

701
00:40:49,047 --> 00:40:52,551
I couldn't find him in
the middle of a goddamn riot.

702
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:55,787
Your men came after me.
Well, they're not all ours.

703
00:40:55,821 --> 00:40:57,589
Just 'cause we lit the fuse

704
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,558
doesn't mean
we control the explosion.

705
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:01,593
You weren't supposed to be
on that floor anyway.

706
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:05,163
You said you wanted it done
immediately, so I got it done.

707
00:41:08,634 --> 00:41:10,802
This woman who saw you,

708
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,972
did you get her name?

709
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,807
Lydia Riley.

710
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,979
We'll take care of it.

711
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,214
So, you were able
to follow everything

712
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,283
on that sheet of paper?

713
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:29,287
Angela, if you didn't do
everything on that list...

714
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,256
Yes, yeah, I got it done.

715
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,024
Good.

716
00:41:33,058 --> 00:41:34,660
There's a delivery man
waiting for you

717
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:36,528
at Reception on your floor.

718
00:41:36,562 --> 00:41:38,530
Give him the package
with everything in it.

719
00:41:38,564 --> 00:41:40,866
Irving?

720
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:43,234
Are you still gonna evacuate
the Recovery Center?

721
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:47,038
That's been done already.

722
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:50,842
- So this is really happening?
- We need you to stay strong.

723
00:41:50,876 --> 00:41:52,544
It's like you said,

724
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:54,880
she can make all of this better.

725
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:57,315
This is a step toward that.

726
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,117
Remember the cause.

727
00:42:52,938 --> 00:42:55,707
Attention, all E Corp employees,

728
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:57,776
this is an emergency.

Please stay on your floor.

Lock all doors, and find
your nearest safe zone.

Stay away from

Attention, all E Corp employees,

Please stay on your floor.

736
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,329
Angela...

737
00:44:26,364 --> 00:44:28,433
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

738
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:33,872
Attention, all E Corp employees,

739
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,007
this is an emergency.

Attention, all E Corp employees,

745
00:44:49,788 --> 00:44:52,290
this is an emergency.

746
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:53,363

I followed you.

on the day of the U.N. vote.

the Dark Army

They're trying to blow up
the downtown building today.

- This is a zero sum game.
Accept the truth.

The Recovery building's
going to explode,

22
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,448
and the people inside
right along with it.

23

behind this.

00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,717
I gotta stop her.

25
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,685

evacuate the Recovery center?

27

- That's been done already.

28
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:57,625

Angela Moss.

29
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,161
I'm here to discuss
the Washington Township case.

Dad, what's going on?

- 26 employees died from
similar types of leukemia.

32
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,569
- Evil Corp killed my mom,

33
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:13,341
and my whole life,
I've always wanted justice...

34
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,708
for her death.

this one, yeah.

Elliot has these on VHS.

54
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,163
- Is Elliot here,
Mr. Alderson?

55
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:12,533

he didn't come.

- Well, I guess he wasn't
feeling up to it.

59
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:24,245
- I don't wanna
be here, either.

60
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,149
- There's a lot of
nice people visiting.

61
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:33,354
Are you sure you don't wanna
join the party?

62
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,356
We got this cake.

63
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,525
Red Velvet.

64
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:39,493
- Not hungry.
- [chuckles]

65
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:52,440
You know,
if that were me over there,

66
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:53,841
I would want Elliot and Darlene

67
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:56,844
to come over and talk to me.

68
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:02,383

to talk to her.

Enchantment Under the Sea dance

73
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,797
in the first
"Back to the Future" movie?

74
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,900
Marty had to push his dad

75
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:22,303
to ask Lorraine to be his date.

76
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:26,240
And if George didn't
overcome his fear,

77
00:03:26,274 --> 00:03:27,675
they would never
have gotten married,

78
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,710
and Marty would never
have been born,

79
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:33,714
and he would've disappeared
from that photograph, right?

80
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:35,983
*

81
00:03:36,016 --> 00:03:37,485

00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,989
I know it's scary,

84
00:03:42,022 --> 00:03:46,760
but I also know
that you can do it.

85
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:48,729
Just might need a little push.
That's all.

86
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:49,963

89
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,710
- Hey, Angela,

90
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:05,379
somewhere down the road,

91
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:09,883
if Elliot needs some help
and...

92
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:12,019
I can't
be there for him...

93
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:17,625
Just give him
a little push too, okay?

94
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,028
- Okay.

95
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,632
*

96
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:27,968
- You understand?
- Of course, Emily.

97
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,671
Also, I know
we discussed it before,

98
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:33,641
but I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't bring it up again.

99
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:37,010
It's about the anonymous
benefactor who keeps--

100
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:39,780
- I'll let you two talk.
- Don...

101

*

102
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,653
- Sorry, did I say something
I shouldn't have?

103
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,356
- Not at all.
You're fine.

104
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:51,359
- Well, he reached out again,
offering to pay for your--

105
00:04:51,392 --> 00:04:53,561
- That's very nice of him,

106
00:04:53,594 --> 00:04:55,596
but I've made my decision.

107
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,431
No more treatments.

108
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:58,999
I wanna spend
what time I have left

109
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,335
with my friends and family.

110
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,873
- Just know that there's still
people fighting for you,

111
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,575
for your family.

112
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,009
We're gonna continue
with the lawsuit

113
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,646
and do everything we can
in your name.

- Hi.

118
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,776
- What do you think
of the party?

119
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,445
- This isn't fun.

120
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:45,879
It's weird.

121
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,416

123
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:53,787
It's okay.
You can say it.

124

I'm dying.
- I don't want to.

00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,991
I hate this.

you know this isn't
good-bye, right?

out there for both of us,

that we'll see
each other again.

141

And we'll play and dance

for the better.

Angela, whatever White Rose
told you is a lie.

She's a fucking terrorist,
and if you let this happen--

192
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,628
- Then we're going to
look back

193
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,630
and see that these consequences
were necessary--

off of that machine,

to be in this building?

- What did you say to him?
- What I had to.

225

- Well, excuse me
for doubting you,

226
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,234
but you never struck me as
a country-first type of gal.

What's going on?

234
00:10:50,918 --> 00:10:53,220

- Yes.

- Positive.

Find out where he's headed.

We can keep him safe.

don't do anything stupid, okay?

seems credible, sir.

*

682
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,411
[groans]
The kill command.

683
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:22,248
Here I am, trying to use it
to stop this attack

684
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:25,251
while Mr. Robot
is trying to use it on me.

685
00:36:25,284 --> 00:36:27,686
Does that just mean
we cancel each other out,

686
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:31,490
fighting so hard,
we end up standing in place?

687
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,826
Fuck that.
I gotta keep moving.

688
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,497
*

689
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,299
- Dude, you okay?

690
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,634
- [whispers] Yeah.

691
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,782
- You disobeyed a direct order.
I told you, flat out--

692
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,884
- I already told you
it was a site survey.

693
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,886
Report me if you want.

694
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:03,255
- Then why am I standing
in a goddamn basement

695
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:06,258
with the door kicked in?
- There were signs of a fire.

696
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,759
I did my job.

697
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:10,596
I'd do it again,
if given the opportunity.

698
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:11,597
[camera shutter clicks]

699
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,732
Anything else?

700
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:18,504
- All right.

701
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:20,439
Look...

702
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:22,974
despite your blatant disregard
for chain of command,

703
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,511
this was still a win.

704
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:26,878
Wellick was here.

705
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,980
The evidence ERT pulls
out of this shit hole

706
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,883
can only bring us closer
to capturing him.

707
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:33,819
Now, we've got task force
canvassing the tunnels.

708
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:36,355
If Tyrell is in there,
we'll get him.

709
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,528
Why don't you head back
to the office?

710
00:37:42,561 --> 00:37:45,697
When the evidence comes in,
you start sorting through it.

[pounding]

714
00:38:00,346 --> 00:38:03,315
- I can see your big ass eye.
Open up.

715
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,751
- What do you want?
- Open the goddamn door.

716
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:10,856

- Small coffee, black.
- You got it.

723
00:38:32,378 --> 00:38:34,079
- I'm gonna head up
to the office.

724
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:37,483
You gonna be okay?
- I'll be up in a minute.

725
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:39,351
- You fucked us,

726
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:41,553
bent us over the sink
and went to town.

727
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:44,656
- You're not making any sense.
We're on the same side.

[beeping]

729
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:50,762

[door rattling]

Oh, come on, please! Fuck!

[phone buzzes]

734
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,508
- I saw you

735
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,676
manipulating my brother,

736
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,445
turning his condition
against him.

737
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:09,981
- Taking down E Corp
was your plan. Remember?

738
00:39:10,015 --> 00:39:13,051
- [groaning]

739
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:17,055

[women screaming]
No! Stop the attack!

743
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,771
You have to stop the attack!

Get on the ground!

- You're the ones
who dragged me into this.

749
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,687
- We didn't ask you
to blow up a goddamn building

full of people.

751
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,123
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

752
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,593
They're evacuating
the building.

Please, listen to me,
I can help you!

757

- Let's go!
Go, go, go!

758
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,649
- Tell me why I shouldn't
call the FBI and turn you in.

759

- What is it that
you really want, Darlene?

760

With all their paper records
consolidated there,

761

- Folks, get back!
Please stop.

- You can lie to yourself
all you want...

765

But when you're alone at night,
this shit will haunt you.

Trust me on that.

No, no, no, listen to me,

in handcuffs right now,

one last chance.

[uplifting music]

792
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:31,850

which side I'm really on?

And what about Mr. Robot?

801
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:13,959
Does he now understand
that Tyrell and the Dark Army

802
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:17,829
have corrupted
his alleged revolution?

803
00:43:17,863 --> 00:43:20,899

There were no paper records

the bigger picture.

It wasn't a single point
of failure.

the explosions
and fires to occur.

- Fsociety.

For what?

5
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,745

come from this.

he is good to go?

11

When we spoke earlier,

12
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:23,291
he was looking at me
like we'd never met.

13
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:24,625

this doesn't happen again.

- I texted you the address.

16
00:00:27,828 --> 00:00:28,929
- Is that where Tyrell is?
- Yes.

17
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,431
- We gotta act before
Wellick disappears

18
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:32,166
for another five months.

19
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,334
- You said you'd bring
my family to me.

20
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,069
[glass shattering, gunshots]

21
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:37,805
[baby crying]

22
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:40,174
- It's gonna work out
the way we discussed.

23
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,676
- Angela, whatever White Rose
told you is a lie.

24
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,678
- These consequences
were necessary--

25
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,248
- People are going to die!
- No, they're going to be fine!

26
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,251
- Listen to me.
You have to stop the attack.

27
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,354
There's one last thing I need
in order to execute:

28
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,256
the full force
of the Dark Army.

29
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,790
- A reported 71 buildings

30
00:00:56,824 --> 00:00:59,827
owned by E Corp
exploded or caught fire.

31
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,362
- When you see White Rose,

32
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,131
make sure you say
I did you good.

33
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,299
- We're gonna stay with
my buddy in Arizona.

34
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,101
- If what I discovered is real,
do you know what that means?

35
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:09,170
We can potentially undo
this whole thing.

36
00:01:09,203 --> 00:01:11,705
- Excuse me,
do you have the time?

37
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,776
- Reports are still coming in
from across the country...

38
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,545
- [sniffling]

39
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:18,779
- But based on
the number of targets,

40
00:01:18,812 --> 00:01:20,648
we are now in the midst of

41
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,384
the worst attack on U.S. soil

42
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,319
in the history of our nation.

43
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:28,256
In a series of seemingly
orchestrated strikes

44
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:29,757
across the country,

45
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,660
a reported 71 buildings
owned by E Corp

46
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:35,163
exploded or caught fire.

47
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,498
There has been
no official confirmation,

48
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,900
or even speculation,
as to what caused

49
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,470
the explosions
and fires to occur.

50
00:01:42,503 --> 00:01:44,438
Officials with knowledge
of the attacks

51
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:46,540
have stated that
the death toll...

52
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:50,644
- I know it may seem petty
in light of today, but...

53
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:53,247
I just can't stop
thinking about it.

54
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,884
Keep turning it over
in my mind.

55
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:58,786
"Frasier."

56
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,622
Now, my homie said
it's iconic and shit.

57
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:05,693
Even won a record 37
Primetime Emmys, or whatever.

58
00:02:05,726 --> 00:02:07,828
So I started watching.

59
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:11,532
And I'm cool with suspending
my disbelief a little,

60
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:13,434
but this?

61
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,669
Am I really supposed to believe

62
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,871
a baldin' white dude
from Seattle

63
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:21,809
gets to smash that much?

64
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:24,745
And it's not like he was
slaying hood rats, neither.

65
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,615
This nigga get more butt
than ash trays.

66
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:32,553
Turned me off from the fucking
situation comedies altogether.

67
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,288
Had to cleanse the palate.

68
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,390
And I know it only got
one Emmy nomination,

69
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:38,359
but I'll tell you,

70
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,594
you wanna see
a believable protagonist

71
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:43,497
doing extraordinary shit?

72
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:45,866
Don't sleep on
"Knight Rider," yo.

73
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:48,669
- As of now, no one has
claimed responsibility

74
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,804
for this nightmarish attack.

75
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:53,341
- [shaky breathing]
You don't have to kill us.

76
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,976
You know, we can--we--
we can work with you.

77
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,712
Haven't--haven't enough people
died already today?

78
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:01,515
- My man.
My man...

79
00:03:02,616 --> 00:03:04,585
Relax.

80
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,521
Calm down.

81
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,524
If I was here to take you out,

82
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:12,660
would've done it already.

83
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,264
Your roomie here serves as
a prime example to that.

84
00:03:18,266 --> 00:03:19,833
- Then what is it?
Why are you here?

85
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,602
- Oh, just to babysit,

86
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:24,772
to keep you guys
safe and sound.

87
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,874
- Will be tested
in the coming days

88
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:30,678
as we learn more, as we find
those responsible..

89
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,646
- You know,
it's kinda sad, actually,

90
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,616
the general lack of respect
afforded to "Knight Rider."

91
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:38,819
They throw fucking gold statues
at the Crane brothers,

92
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:42,423
but Michael Knight and KITT,

93
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,957
their relationship predicted

94
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:46,427
the current societal
dependence on technology,

95
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,597
and that was 30 years ago.

96
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,766
Plus, anytime Mike spits game
on a chick,

97
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,337
I swear, I believe
every goddamn word.

98
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,471

If nothing else,

101
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,989
"Knight Rider" should've won
a fucking statue

102
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,392
for his dope ass theme song.

103
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:21,028
I mean, the shit
just stays with you.

104
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:27,535
Stuck in my head
right now, in fact.

105
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,840

Advisory System

has issued an imminent
alert bulletin,

111
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:36,404

71 E Corp buildings

were targeted
in a coordinated attack

113
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:40,541
unlike any the world has seen.

114
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,444
At this time,
many looming questions remain:

115
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:44,945
the cause of the explosions

116
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,947
that brought
so much destruction,

117
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,684
or worse, if any additional
attacks are to follow.

118
00:05:50,718 --> 00:05:52,786
[siren wailing]
Unfortunately, what we do know

119
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,987
is that...

Just calm down
and keep breathing.

125
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,834
- Okay.
- And you can tell me

126
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,001
what it is
that you think you did, okay?

127
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,970
Just breathe,

128
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,973
and whenever you're ready,
we can talk.

129
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,975

00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:21,241
- Hello, Mr. Robot.

158
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,043
- [chuckles]

159
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,912
Of course he comes running
to you after today.

160
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,581
So predictable.

161
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:29,817

to speak to me, but...

conscious or not,

163
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:32,853
I suspect that he thought
it was more important

164
00:07:32,886 --> 00:07:34,688
that I speak to you.

165
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:36,189
- Why do you have to keep
going through a middleman?

166
00:07:36,223 --> 00:07:37,791
Why can't he just
speak to me himself?

167
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,226
- I'm not sure he wants to,

168
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:42,095
but I wanna help you
figure out why.

169
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,797
Elliot told me he's worried

170
00:07:43,831 --> 00:07:45,165
that you may have done
something harmful.

171
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,800
Do you know what
he might be referencing?

- [chuckles]

173
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:50,170
Everything that happened today

174
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:52,640
is because he was ignoring
our responsibilities.

It's not me
he has to worry about.

181

It's the others,
the real string pullers.

182
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,123
- Who would that be?

183
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:12,159

what's really going on?

Look around, sweetheart.

I'm not the only one
under their thumb.

186
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:19,533
They're manipulating
everything, always,

187
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:23,203
just to line their own pockets,
to have total control.

188
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,039
But that's the conspiracy, man.

189
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:28,609
- So you and Elliot--

190
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:31,679
you want to challenge
these manipulators?

191
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:33,947
- Me and Elliot wanted
to take the control away,

192
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:37,117
give it back to the ones
who were getting shit on.

193

We got halfway there,
until someone swiped my ideas

194
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:41,755
and warped them to suit
whatever bullshit agenda

195
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,591
served their self-interest.

196
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,092
That's what 5/9 was about,

197
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,061
our revolution.

198
00:08:48,095 --> 00:08:50,698
- So you are
a supporter of 5/9?

199
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:53,100
- [chuckles]
Supporter?

200
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,769
I was no supporter.

201
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,338
I was the architect!

202
00:08:58,371 --> 00:08:59,873
- How about telling me
why you think

203
00:08:59,907 --> 00:09:01,609
Elliot might be upset with you?

204
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:04,745
- [scoffs] I don't have time
for this shit.

205
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,247
I gotta find the pricks
who screwed me.

206
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,949
Turn on the news, lady.

207
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,818
All these buildings
fucking blowing up.

208
00:09:10,851 --> 00:09:12,185
I think they're trying
to pin that shit on me.

209
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,187
I know it.
It ain't happening.

210
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,023
- So, the attacks today
were a part of

211
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,058
the revolution you created?

212
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,127
Is that what you're saying?

213
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,629
- [sighs]

214
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:24,231
*

215
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,767
We were only supposed to
take out one location,

216
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,870
once all the paper records
were centralized.

217
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,706
That was it.

218
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,374
- Yeah, I've gotta be honest
with you, Mr. Robot,

219
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,677
this sounds like
delusions of grandeur.

220
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,679
- [scoffs]

221
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:41,148
- How else do you explain what
the authorities are saying?

222
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:45,018
They claim to have
the man responsible.

223
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,987
- Wellick?

224
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,123
No, he was working for me,

225
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:52,025
but you and the rest
of the world

226
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,961
are never gonna know that,
because you keep happily

227
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,063
lapping up those sugar-coated
pearls of semen

228
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,998
they keep pouring down
your throats.

229
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,399
You're buying the narrative

230
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,034
that they've been pushing
for months.

231
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:02,636
Pigs at a trough!

232
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:07,841
*

233
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:09,877
You still don't believe me.

234
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,846
*

235
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,314
You're indulging me right now,

236
00:10:14,347 --> 00:10:16,316
like I'm one of
your nutso patients.

237
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:23,390
*

238
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:31,665
Do the math.

239
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,433
Elliot worked at Allsafe,

240
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,403
ground zero for 5/9.

241
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:38,338
He was also arrested
for hacking.

242
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,974
He even hacked you, didn't he?

243
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:44,277
And he's completely
out of his mind.

244
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,346
You add all that up...

245
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:49,416
*

246
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,953
You still want to doubt me?

247
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:56,156
*

248
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,025
- Good people of Earth,

249
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:01,194
there is more up our sleeves.

250
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:04,231
71 buildings is a parlor trick.

251
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:07,467
Our true act of sorcery
will astound

252
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,738
within the next 24 hours.

253
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:14,241
To all fat cats,
gluttons, and honchos,

254
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:16,243
as you lazily don

255
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,178
your ribbons of remembrance

256
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,413
for this tragic day,

257
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,818
do not forget,
the clock is ticking.

258
00:11:24,852 --> 00:11:26,754
[beeps]

259
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,225
- I think the public
may lose faith in the Bureau,

260
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:34,728
once they learn
that you squandered

261
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,897
the chance to prevent
another attack.

262
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,265
- I'm not gonna be
strong-armed,

263
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,100
not by you,
not after today.

264
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:41,835
- Then I suggest
you start taking

265
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,304
my client's words seriously.
- This is unreal.

266
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,074
The country's under attack,
and you're protecting him?

267
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,909
- Wellick was targeted,

268
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:52,512
because of his access
and credentials at E Corp.

269
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,749
These terrorists threatened
his wife and son

270
00:11:55,783 --> 00:11:57,417
if he didn't comply.

271
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,119
For five straight months,

272
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,954
my client was held captive
in a basement.

273
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,023
- You can't expect us
to buy this.

274
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,357
- We have confirmation.

275
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:05,959
Wellick gave
an unauthorized order

276
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:08,195
to put server CS30
back on the network,

277
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,830
the same night
the hack was initiated,

278
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,531
all while being
investigated for murder.

279
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,100
- Yeah, a charge for which
he's been cleared.

280
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,334
- That doesn't change
the facts.

281
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,369
Wellick got passed over
for CTO,

282
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,471
got fired, two days later,
disappears,

283
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,108
and now, hours before
the largest terror attack ever

284
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,776
on U.S. soil,
Wellick resurfaces,

285
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,244
claiming he was kidnapped.

286
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,847
- So, what,
are you charging my client

287
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,982
with coincidental resurfacing?

288
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:30,517
- We don't call that
coincidence around here.

289
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,285
We call it bullshit.
- Dom...

290
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,354
- We have motive.
- Yeah, with no hard evidence.

291
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,489
[solemn music]

292
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:38,959
But here's what you do have.

293
00:12:38,992 --> 00:12:40,961
You have a guy
that'll point you

294
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,263
to the terrorists
who held him hostage,

295
00:12:43,296 --> 00:12:46,800
the actual people
behind the attacks,

296
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:50,003
the same ones planning
more destruction.

297
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:52,205
Mr. Wellick can ID them,

298
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:54,007
and tell you
their likely location,

299
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,810
in exchange for
protection and immunity.

300
00:12:56,844 --> 00:12:58,311
- We're not gonna cut a deal.
- We're gonna charge him

301
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,413
and just add obstruction
of justice on top of it.

302
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,482
- You saw the video.

303
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:04,885
Time is not a luxury
that you have,

304
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:08,856
not with another attack
on the horizon, so...

305
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,490
do you really wanna sit here

306
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,326
and continue to quibble
about Mr. Wellick?

307
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,297
*

308
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,866
- Let's just
round them all up,

309
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,034
Darlene, Elliot, Angela Moss.

310
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:23,236
Let's just haul 'em all in here
and go at 'em hard.

311
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,604
- Wellick's lawyer is right.

312
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,239
Time is not our friend here.

313
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,975
And if Tyrell can get us
two workable leads--

314
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,476
- We're being played!

315
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,178
How do you not see this?

316
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,980
I still think
the Dark Army's involved,

317
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:34,547
and bringing in the others
might expose that.

318
00:13:34,581 --> 00:13:36,116
- I have to brief Comey,

319
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,118
and he has to brief
the President.

320
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,987
I won't go to them with
half-assed theories again,

321
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,621
not when this much
is on the line.

322
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,256
- Why do you keep ignoring
our credible sources?

323
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,558
- The most credible one
being in that room.

324
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,294
Tyrell Wellick's name alone

325
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:49,029
is going to play better
with them than the others.

326
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,898
- Play better?

327
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,100
Are you already wondering
how this is gonna look?

328
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,868
You wanna cover this up
to the FBI Director

329
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,369
and the President of
the United States?

330
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:57,971
- Spare me
the conspiracy theories.

331
00:13:58,005 --> 00:13:59,406
I need to bring them
something concrete.

332
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:01,041
- And if Wellick's lying?

333
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,442
- Then this deal is off,
and we have our guy.

334
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:03,977
It's a win-win for us,
either way.

335
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,412
Why are you fighting
with me on this?

336
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,280
- Because something's
not adding up.

337
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,616
*

338
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,919
- What's that supposed to mean?

339
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:15,188
*

340
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,224
I don't know if this is
because you're overworked

341
00:14:17,257 --> 00:14:19,192
or stressed out
or just under some delusion

342
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,395
that you're a fucking
super-cop, but it stops now.

343
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,197
[tense music]

344
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:27,067
You report to me.

345
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,902
Start remembering that.

346
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:31,104
*

347
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,440
- As to what caused
the explosions and fires to--

348
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:35,408
- ...Tyrell Wellick
and took him into custody...

349
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,044
- ...Warned of another attack

350
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,579
within the next 24 hours.

351
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,414
- ...Of our company's
paper rec--

352
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,016
- Officials with knowledge
of the attacks

353
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,651
have stated that
the death toll

354
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,386
is expected to be well...

355
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:49,256
- Right now,
the estimate's around 3,000.

356
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,259
- What estimate?

357
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:54,094
- The dead.

358
00:14:55,963 --> 00:14:58,098
But it's still climbing.

359
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,904
- Okay, maybe you should just
chill with the TV for a second.

360
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,309
- They're gonna be okay, right?

361
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,344
- Who's that?

362
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,680
- All those people who died.

363
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,585
Do you think that
they're gonna be okay?

364
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:23,423
[soft instrumental music]

365
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:26,960
- I'm gonna go grab my shit
and come back.

366
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:29,362
It won't be long.

367
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:31,698
Just don't go anywhere, okay?

368
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:38,972
*

369
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:46,079
- Can we just take a break?
I, um--I might need a minute.

370
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:48,215
- Unfortunately,
that's not possible.

371
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:50,517

get bigger bedrooms.

685
00:42:58,243 --> 00:43:01,079
That was a big one.

686
00:43:01,112 --> 00:43:03,782
You would always wish
for more protractors,

687
00:43:03,815 --> 00:43:05,917
which was weird.

688
00:43:05,951 --> 00:43:09,120
I would wish for
a faster computer.

689
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:12,257
Probably faster modem too.

for better clothes.

care about that.

00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:22,901
We both...

694
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:24,736

And eat lots
of Sour Patch Kids

700
00:43:37,983 --> 00:43:42,087
that we would buy
from gas stations.

701
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,255
After we made all our wishes...

702

*

703
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:50,195
We'd close our eyes
really hard,

704
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,363
hoping that when
we opened them,

705
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:55,433
it'd all come true.

706
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:59,170
And we thought the harder
we closed them,

707
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,339
the stronger our wishes
would be.

708

And even though
they never came true,

710
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,015
we still liked doing it.

711
00:44:10,048 --> 00:44:12,450
Because the ending was never
our favorite part, anyway.

used to say to me

we opened our eyes

[dog barking]

109
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,912
- Mr. Robot.

110
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:54,515
He took over again.

111
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:58,118
"They own the FBI."

112
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,053
What is he trying to say?

113
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,490
Who's they?

114
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:05,559
[dog barking]

115
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,964
Dark Army. It's gotta be.

Fuck, I left my machine
unlocked.

119
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,052
Trenton's e-mail.

120
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:33,887
Did he see this?

121
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,956
If he did, he knows that
Trenton was close

122
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,891
to finding a way
to undo Five/Nine,

123
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,662
and that I'm gonna finish
what she started.

124
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,000
He also looked up info
on Tyrell Wellick's release.

125
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,508
Why?

126
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:59,780
What exactly did Mr. Robot
do last night?

127
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,850
[siren wailing]

128
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,075
- 71 buildings.

129
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:30,210
Was it worth it?

130
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,279
- Get the fuck out of my home.

131
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:36,049
- Gotta say, your revised
plan was batshit insane.

132
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,118
It was supposed to be only one
building, but what you did--

133
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:39,620
- I did what had to be done.

134
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,921
- You mean what
they told you to do.

135
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,856
What'd they promise
you, huh? Money?

136
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,058
- This isn't about them. This
is about when you fucked me!

137
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,860
I lost everything
because of you.

138
00:08:46,894 --> 00:08:51,632
My son's taken to Denmark,
and my wife's dead!

139
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:53,333
- Okay.

140
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,869
Okay, I can't say that
it's all been smooth sailing,

141
00:08:55,903 --> 00:08:57,004
but you gotta see
the big picture!

142
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,706
- There is no big picture!

143
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:01,074
There was a job, and I
fulfilled my duty,

144
00:09:01,108 --> 00:09:02,943
and that's more than
I can say for you.

145
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:04,244
- Oh, come on. You know
damn well

146
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,913
that's not how the
Dark Army works.

147
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,148
You don't go from most
wanted man on the planet

148
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,817
to hero unless they
have plans for you,

149
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,318
how can you not see that?

150
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,153
- The things I did,
the things I sacrificed,

151
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,722
I earned my freedom.

152
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,123
That's the least
they could give me.

153
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,791
- Horseshit.
You're being added

154
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,326
to a collection of
puppets.

155
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,294
- No puppet, no puppet.
You're the puppet!

156
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,965
- Wake up! You made a deal with
a force that's bigger than you!

157
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,267
When the time comes,
they're gonna ask you to pay

158
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,069
what they feel you owe them!

159
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,904
- This is a childish
conspiracy!

160
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:33,607
- Childish? Who's the one
who said we were gods, huh?

161
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,375
Time to grow up.
There are no gods.

162
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,612
Our closest deities are
a society of the richest,

163
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,180
most influential
men in existence.

164
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:41,849
- I'm done with this.

165
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,383
- Men who fuck over
the rest of us for profit,

166
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,119
for fun, and then leave us
in the streets for dead.

167
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,922
Just like your Joanna!

170
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,373
- You don't talk
about my wife.

171
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:09,643
- Wouldn't she want you to
realize the truth and fight?

172
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:17,150
Or would she want you
to be their little bitch?

173
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,153

There you go. Fight!

176
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,129
That's the Tyrell
who's been missing.

177
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:30,864
Now you want to stop them, too,

178
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,332
before they put you
in that choke collar?

179
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,835
Unless you're into
that sort of thing.

180
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,738

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,882
- What?

183
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:53,053
Oh, hello, sir.

184
00:10:53,086 --> 00:10:55,122
- May I come in?

185
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,433
- Oh, shit.

186
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,272
- Didn't mean to interrupt.

187
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,345
Good evening, Mr. Alderson.

188
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:20,848
Please join us.

189
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:23,884
After all, you were
a part of this too.

190
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:43,070
- It's weird,
being here again.

191
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:44,805
Like we've come
to that slow glide

192
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,840
at the end of
a roller coaster.

193
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:49,176
We're coming full circle.

194
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,812
Darlene and Mr. Robot
started this whole thing,

195
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:53,847
and now she and I
are gonna end it.

196
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,482
Trenton was
investigating Romero

197
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,985
ever since she found out he
was monitoring our machines.

198
00:11:58,018 --> 00:12:00,053
- This is big.

199
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,925
Why'd she send this to you?

200
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,393
- I don't know.

201
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,961
- If Trenton's right, and
encryption keys

202
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:10,764
were exported the
night of the hack,

203
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:14,034
then there's a chance we can
recover all of E Corp's data.

204
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,435
- If we can find those keys.

205
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,905
- Why would Romero do this?

206
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,773
There was never supposed
to be a Plan B,

207
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,208
that was the whole point.

208
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,376
This hack was supposed
to be all in.

209
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,813
- He did it for the reason
we need those keys now,

210
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,247
in case our revolution failed.

211
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,349
We need access to his
keylogger files.

212
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,351
The feds confiscated
his drives.

213
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:34,154
Now all of his data is in the
FBI evidence storage system.

214
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:36,957
- Sentinel, yeah,
I know it well.

215
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,992
- That's why I'm here.

216
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,194
I need you to give me all the
intel you have about the FBI.

217
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,097
- You do realize this isn't
Angela batting her lashes

218
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:45,799
at some feds to drop
a femtocell

219
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,367
at their E Corp
office?

220
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,003
Sentinel is the Fort Knox
of closed networks.

221
00:12:50,037 --> 00:12:51,972
And you want us to just
waltz in there and--

222
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:54,007
- Not us.

223
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,542
Me. I'm gonna do it.

224
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,945
- Did you not hear me?
You will get busted.

225
00:12:57,978 --> 00:13:00,080
I don't care how good
you think you are.

226
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,083
[dramatic music]

227
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:06,219
*

228
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,588
The only way we do this
is if I go to them.

229
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,959
I'll hit up my contact--
- We can't trust them.

230
00:13:14,394 --> 00:13:16,496
The Dark Army owns the FBI.

231
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,866
- How do you know that?
- Doesn't matter.

232
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,936
Going to them isn't an option.

233
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:26,206
- I might have an angle.
- No, I told you--

234
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,575
- I spent the last two months
working with the feds.

235
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:32,012
I know how the operate.
I'm miles ahead of you on this.

236
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,446
Okay? I can do this.

237
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,615
- What's your angle?

238
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:40,353
- My angle is you trust me.

239
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:43,156
- You gotta promise me.

240
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,226
Any sign of trouble, you bail.

241
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,398
- Even if we do this,

242
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,867
do you really think
it'll make a difference?

243
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:55,903
I mean the whole world
has gone to shit.

244
00:13:55,936 --> 00:14:00,407
- And we did that. All we can
do now is rebuild.

245
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,977
At least that's a start.

246
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:06,279
- And the Dark Army?

247
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,448
You think they're just gonna be
painting each other's toenails

248
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,583
while we go and undo everything
they've worked for?

249
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:14,554
- You just worry about
getting into Sentinel.

250
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:18,625
Let me worry about
the Dark Army.

251
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,493
- Believe me now?

252
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,963
Lovely lady like you
with a Taurus?

253
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,265
I don't think so.
It's not a good fit.

254
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:26,967
But this baby, huh?

255
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,368
- It's nice.

256
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,470
- Bang a left up here.

257
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:35,508
I hear you're looking
to barter a TAG Heuer?

258
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,577
- My ex-husband's.

259
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:39,913
- I'm sure we can
arrange a deal.

260
00:14:39,947 --> 00:14:43,483
And I really want to feel
you pump the gas here.

261
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,685
Let her open up.

262
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,154
[laughing]

263
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:50,290
Yeah?

264
00:14:50,323 --> 00:14:53,393
Doesn't that feel good?

265
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,462
[alarm dinging]
- Oh.

266
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:58,498
Is this supposed to--
I think it's dead.

267
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:01,334
- You know what? Coast her to
the shoulder here on the left.

268
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:04,404
I'll check things out.

269
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,009
Onboard computer's
so smart,

270
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,643
it probably senses something.

00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,245
[door opens]

272
00:15:14,181 --> 00:15:16,549
- What are you doing?

273
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,287
- You know what to do.

274
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:33,166
- Tell you what, why don't you
stroll on back to the lot,

275
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,970
peruse those Sonatas.

276
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:38,471
I'll meet you there
in a second.

277
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:40,073
Go ahead.

278
00:15:40,107 --> 00:15:42,142
I'm right behind you.

279
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:52,986
- I called OnStar and the cops
are on their way,

280
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,388
so we don't have much time.
I need you to set a meet.

281
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,057
- Look kid, I already
told you, we're done--

282
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,425
- Stage Three.

283
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,293
- What the fuck
is Stage Three?

284
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:04,297
- Just do what you do and set
the meet with Whiterose.

285
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,066
- Since when do I take
orders from you?

286
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,001
- If you don't move on this,

287
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:10,170
it'll be on you
to tell your employer

288
00:16:10,203 --> 00:16:12,239

their timeline.

- You're late.

294
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,627
- I'm surprised
you agreed to meet.

295
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:36,429
Thought you weren't
allowed one on ones.

296
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,165
- Technically you're
not a source anymore,

297
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,800
so I'll classify
this as a social meet.

298
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,503
But I suggest you get to the
point of why you called.

299
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:45,738
- First, how about
a peace offering?

Shots?

301
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:49,342
- You said you had
something to tell me.

302
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:52,545
So talk or this is over.

303
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,784

There are things
I haven't told you.

308
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,432
- I'm listening.

309

does this work?

00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:22,375

am I fucking my own immunity?

00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:24,444
- Depends.

312
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:37,557
- Everything you said,
you were on point.

313
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,360
Whiterose was
behind everything.

314
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,496
Five/Nine, the Dark Army
were our partners.

315
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,566
They handled the Chinese side,
we took care of it over here.

316
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,103
- And Whiterose, did
you talk to him?

317
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:51,471
- There was a middle man.

318
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:53,106
- If the Dark Army
was involved,

319
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,175
then Whiterose had to
greenlight it.

320
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,146
Would you be willing to go on
the record about what you know?

321
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:02,415
- If I testified...

322
00:18:02,449 --> 00:18:04,384
You know what the
Dark Army's capable of.

323
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,619
- Darlene, you gotta
rethink this.

324
00:18:06,653 --> 00:18:10,623
We can protect you,
we'll make things right.

She exploited your feelings
about your mom,

347
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:55,428
and used them against you.
That's what she does.

our parents back.

you've got some untapped
talent.

Did you hear me?

404
00:22:56,943 --> 00:22:58,878
Did you hear what we
were saying out there?

405
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:01,514

Aren't you?

to trick me.

00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,938
That's why you wanted me
to explain everything.

414

It's you who's trying

to maintain.

as a formality, Wellick,

to fake a smile and pretend
to welcome you back.

430
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:23,095
You have been appointed
CTO at E Corp.

- [scoffs]

432
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:31,237
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

You coming here personally--
- Yes, yes. Right, right.

434
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,810
But the direct
purpose of my visit--

435
00:24:37,844 --> 00:24:39,979
I felt it was important to
share with you formally

436
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:44,651
that the CTO title is
nothing more than that.

437
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:49,689
You are a mere
figurehead I inherited

438
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,692
from a deal gone wrong.

439
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:56,062
It happens from time to time.

440
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:58,798
But I wanted you to understand
the nature of your position

441
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:04,003
in case you should
have loftier designs.

442
00:25:04,937 --> 00:25:06,839
There'll be none of that.

443
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:12,244
Obedience will be your
only task at my company.

444
00:25:12,278 --> 00:25:16,315

potentially get awkward

00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,886
if you thought differently,

446
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,690
so I came here
out of respect.

447
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:37,904
By your silence, I assume
you accept this position?

448
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:42,975
- I know what this is.

449
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,945
You're embarrassed
that you fired me.

450

There's no shame in
admitting the truth.

You're out of moves and
your company needs me.

00:25:58,825 --> 00:26:03,630
- Oh, Wellick, Wellick.

455
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:09,168
It's not that I'm out of moves.

456
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:11,838
It's that you're not worth one.

457
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:19,979
See you at the office, mm?

458
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:23,650
- Five/Nine, fsociety.

459
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:26,252
You knew the entire time,
didn't you?

460
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:29,321
- Five/Nine, yes.

461
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:33,192
Well, not all the
minutiae, of course.

462
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,261
But since the cyber bombings,

463
00:26:35,294 --> 00:26:38,965
the breadcrumbs haven't been
that difficult to follow.

464
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,134
World catastrophes like this,

465
00:26:42,168 --> 00:26:45,838
they aren't caused by
lone wolves like you.

466
00:26:45,872 --> 00:26:51,844
They occur because
men like me allow them.

467
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:54,380
You just happened to
stumble into one of them.

468
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:58,117
- No, no. I ran the operation.
I pushed the button.

469
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,086
I am the one--
- There you go again.

470
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,723
"I, I, I..."

471
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:06,092
You're still thinking
like a lone wolf.

472
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,396
- Why don't you tell me
how I should be thinking?

473
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:11,998
- Like a leader!

474
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:13,900
- I am a leader!

475
00:27:13,933 --> 00:27:15,968
- Then where are
your followers?

476
00:27:22,742 --> 00:27:28,881
You can't force an
agenda, Mr. Alderson.

477
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:32,885
You have to inspire one.

478
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,756
- [laughing]

479
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,359
- Nice digs.

480
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,994
- Remember, I only let you in

481
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,230
because you said you're
not into girls.

482
00:27:44,263 --> 00:27:47,233
- No, I said I wasn't
a lesbian, end quote.

483
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:49,301
I didn't say I wasn't
into girls.

484
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:55,307
- Very clever.

485
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:58,210
- How about that nightcap?

486
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,947
- Right, but only one.

487
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,183
I gotta work in the morning,

488
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:08,254
and you gotta get
home before curfew.

489
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:12,892
- Screw curfew.

490
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:13,960
Hey, that rhymes.

491
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:18,497
An E Kit?

492
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,200
God, I can't believe
you bought into that shit.

493
00:28:21,233 --> 00:28:23,002
- You can never
be too prepared.

494
00:28:23,035 --> 00:28:24,837
- Such a Girl Scout.

495
00:28:24,871 --> 00:28:28,340
- You think that's Girl
Scout-y? Check this out.

496
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,243
Alexa, give me
the daily Five/Nine.

497
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:34,981
- Hello, and welcome to your
daily Five/Nine report.

498
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:38,117
Officials advise to stay away
from the Upper East Side,

499
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,253
where armed theft
is at peak levels.

500
00:28:41,287 --> 00:28:43,189
- Impressive.

501
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,425
What else does that thing do?

502
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,494
- Alexa, play John Prine.

503
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,763
- Shuffling songs
by John Prine.

504
00:28:50,797 --> 00:28:53,365
["Angel from Montgomery"
plays]

505
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,434
- That's better.

506
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,179
Why you didn't go after
that blonde is beyond me.

507
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:10,282
She was mint.
- Wasn't meant to be.

508
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:13,352
- Whatevs. You didn't even try.

509
00:29:17,223 --> 00:29:19,258
- Jesus H., I think I'm drunk.

510
00:29:23,062 --> 00:29:24,931
But it's...

511
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:26,332
Probably a good thing,

512
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:29,468
'cause I have like
legit trouble sleeping.

513
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:31,904
I take melatonin, but I gotta
down, like, six of them

514
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,973
to even get drowsy, and then--

515
00:29:34,006 --> 00:29:37,944
- * Send me an angel
who flies from Montgomery *

516
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:39,578
What was that?

517
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:43,449
- It's cool.
- No, it's--

518
00:29:43,482 --> 00:29:45,517
No, it's not.

519

What am I doing?
This isn't professional.

520

I'm not a source anymore.

521

Believe it or not,
I'm actually a real person.

522
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:08,841
- Darlene, seriously.
- All right.

523
00:30:08,875 --> 00:30:13,245
Fine. I'm sorry, it's just--

524
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,848
I like you.

525
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:18,017
- You're drunk.

526
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:21,020
- Come on, at least give
me more credit than that.

527
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:27,059
- * And no matter how I try,
the years just flow by *

528
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:31,864
* like a broken down dam

529

* Make me an angel that
flies from Montgomery *

530

Um, one second.

532
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:52,618

that I can hold on to *

* To believe in this living
is just a hard way to go *

in the kitchen *

Don't overthink this.

We're not safe here.

544
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:03,255
I have to warn her. She has to
know what they heard.

545
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,996
I could just get on the subway,
she'll find us like before.

546
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:11,563
She'll protect us.

[phone buzzing]

548
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,001
- Since the cyber bombings,

549
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,969
there's been a
wave of backlash

550
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,704
against the FBI from
Americans of all backgrounds

551
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:23,242
and political views...

552
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,545
The one thing we heard over
and over from those--

553
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,415
was the sentiment that our
law enforcement agencies

554
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:33,752
can no longer be trusted.

563
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:19,365

information on Stage Three.

- I need my laptop.
It has my plans.

568
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,433
- It's fine.

569
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:58,070
We can pull everything
we need from there.

The first time you and I met
to discuss the E Corp hack,

573
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,831
you said this was
a two-step plan.

574
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:31,103
So I'm sure you can imagine my
surprise when out of the blue,

575
00:34:31,137 --> 00:34:34,640
I now hear there is a third.

576
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:40,379
So, Mr. Alderson, why don't you
tell me what it is you want?

577
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,748
- I asked for a meet
with Whiterose.

578
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:45,551
- I'll relay any
messages to her.

579
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:47,419
- I need to speak
with her directly.

580
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,789
- You've had all the time
you'll ever get with Whiterose.

581
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:53,192
- I thought she wanted
to kill E Corp.

582
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,893
- Yes, I believe
that's what we did.

583
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,662
- No, E Coin didn't exist

584
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:58,730
when we first
created this plan.

585
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:01,233
Now it's the only thing
keeping them afloat.

586
00:35:01,267 --> 00:35:03,335
It's becoming the
world standard.

587
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:08,474
And E Corp's entire
existence relies upon it.

588
00:35:08,507 --> 00:35:11,543
- So what do you propose we do?

589
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,145
- If you truly want
to end them,

590
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:16,815
eliminating E Coin
is the only way.

591
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:19,618
- Mr. Alderson,
is this everything

592
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:22,454
that you came
to discuss with me?

Anything else on your mind?

630
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,692
You see how they operate?
In the shadows.

631
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:17,763
You just settle in, smile, nod.

632
00:38:17,796 --> 00:38:20,799
When the time is right...

633
00:38:20,832 --> 00:38:22,568
We'll expose them.

634
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:24,035
Do you get it now?

635
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,805
E Corp, they might as well
be a front for them!

636
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:29,975
Whiterose, Price,
their friends,

637
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,711
they're the ones
we need to take down.

638
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,846
We just need a launching pad.

639
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,684
A place to begin, dig in.

640
00:38:38,717 --> 00:38:43,422
Find that vulnerability.

641
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:47,593
- The FBI.

642
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:50,662
The Dark Army has a man
on the inside.

643
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:53,932
- I don't understand.
- How do you not understand?

644
00:38:53,965 --> 00:38:55,033
You were trying to hack me.

645
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,835
An FBI agent.

646
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:58,404
- And I already told you why.

647
00:38:58,437 --> 00:38:59,638
- Your bullshit's
not gonna fly!

648
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:02,674
- Enough!

649
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:05,544
You gonna fill me in?

650
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:07,613
- Tell him.

651
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:12,050
- Get fucked.

652
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:16,622
Every time you guys get intel,
one of my friends ends up dead.

653
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,557
And Tyrell's bullshit release

654
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,726
was as pathetic
as a dry hand job.

655
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:23,929
Why should I trust you
or anyone else here?

656
00:39:23,962 --> 00:39:27,833
The FBI is obviously in
bed with the Dark Army.

657
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,100
- Where'd you hear that?

658
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:32,103

Why is she here?

663
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,686
- She was in my home,
attempting to steal my badge

664
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,521
to get on Sentinel.

665
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,457
Full disclosure, sir, we had
relations tonight.

666
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,991
I plan on self-reporting
it to the OPR;

667
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,194
I'm not keeping anything
from the Bureau.

668
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,531
- Do you have any
idea how fucking big

669
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:00,966
the crime you committed is?

670
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:02,801
You can forget about
immunity this time.

671
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:04,135
And why the hell
were you trying

672
00:40:04,169 --> 00:40:06,037
to get into Sentinel anyway?

this time, Darlene.

00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,645
You gotta talk.

676
00:40:16,882 --> 00:40:21,052
- There are files in Sentinel
that can help decrypt

677
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,789
all of E Corp's data.

678
00:40:23,822 --> 00:40:27,125
That means bringing
everything back.

679
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:31,029
The solution to undoing
Five/Nine is in a machine

680
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:33,565
on the other side
of this floor, okay?

681
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,601
They're in Romero's collection.

682
00:40:35,634 --> 00:40:39,104
Sit with me,
look over my shoulder,

683
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:42,107
I'll even walk through it with
your engineer, whatever.

684
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:45,777
You guys can personally take
the keys to E Corp

685
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:49,581
and be the heroes, okay?
You can fix everything.

686
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:54,052
Isn't that what you want?

687
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,187
What you've been waiting for?

688
00:40:56,221 --> 00:41:00,091
- She's right! Wasn't this the
point of our entire strategy?

689
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:01,760
- You need to
understand something--

690
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:03,695
- This is the opportunity
we've been chasing!

691
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:05,597
- You're missing the point.
- We have nothing to lose.

692
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,566
If she's lying, we put her in
jail, but if she's not--

693
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,267
- And what if our testimony
gets thrown out

694
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,737
because of your grossly
unprofessional behavior?

695
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:14,706
Sleeping with a CHS,
for Christ's sake.

696
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,975
- She's not a CHS anymore.

697
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:21,847
And you know I didn't
break any rules.

698
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,950
So what's really
happening here?

699
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:27,686
Why not take her
up on her offer?

700
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,655
- Get back to your desk and
write the 302

701
00:41:29,688 --> 00:41:33,892
explaining your actions
minute by minute.

702
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,928

- That will continue to be
part of the debate...

706

What's the plan here? She talks
like she knows everything.

707
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:54,079
- You sound stressed.

708
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:56,782
- Of course I'm fucking
stressed. I could be burnt.

709
00:41:56,815 --> 00:42:00,185
Meanwhile, she claims she
can undo the hack.

710
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:02,588
- And where is she now?

711
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:06,792
- Locked in a goddamn
interview room.

712
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,798
- Okay.

713
00:42:12,831 --> 00:42:15,166
- Is that all you've got?
"Okay"?

714
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,704
Jesus, will you just tell me
how do you want to proceed?

715
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:23,074
- Not one box even packed?

716
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,343
I suppose there's some banal
excuse why a month

717
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,112
isn't enough time
for those lazy mules

718
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,147
to get my project
shipped to the Congo?

719
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:31,116
- Border security.

720
00:42:35,987 --> 00:42:38,690
Border security across
the Eastern seaboard

721
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,926
is restricted to levels
we've never seen before.

722
00:42:40,959 --> 00:42:43,662
- Hence our extensive payroll.

723
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:46,598
We own mayors, district
attorneys,

724
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:49,935
governors, fucking presidents!

725
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:52,938

under martial law.

726

You've always asked
that I be honest with you.

728
00:43:01,046 --> 00:43:03,882
- Speak.

729
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:06,351
- This is your fault.

730
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,791
You blindly indulge all
of Elliot Alderson's whims.

731
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,960
And it has landed us here.

732
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,362
If you'd listened to me,

733
00:43:17,395 --> 00:43:21,332
if you believed in my strategy
as much as you did his,

734
00:43:21,366 --> 00:43:23,769
we could have avoided this.

735
00:43:23,802 --> 00:43:27,372
We had the U.N. vote, these
attacks weren't necessary.

You only get their attention
with force and a lot of it.

740
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:57,635
That is the only
currency with these men.

741
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,886

to our partners

742
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,089
with a more
persuasive argument.

743
00:44:22,327 --> 00:44:26,397

how did he find out?

Does it matter?
I don't need him.

Darlene will be checking
in soon about Sentinel,

757

and I have to enact
Stage Three.

758
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:47,178
- Mr. Alderson is claiming
there is a third stage.

759
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:50,381
He wants to target E Corp.

760
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:54,920
- But I'm sure you knew all
along there is no Stage Three.

761

- A third stage. Odd.

762

That wasn't part of our
original plan, was it?

763
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:08,800
- No.
- So what do you make of that?

764
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:13,038
- His sister is currently
being held at the FBI.

Claiming she can decrypt
E Corp's data.

766
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:23,548
I can't help but notice their
actions are incongruous.

00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:28,987
He's lying to us.

00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:33,058
I don't think their target
is E Corp anymore.

- Get yourself back to work.

773
00:46:47,205 --> 00:46:49,040

contents.

775
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:54,612

You never understood my

You say that I was wrong

about him as well.

00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,193
- My exploit will give me
 full access

15
00:00:25,226 --> 00:00:26,594
to their management
 interface.

16
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,296
Now I own the Dark Army.

17
00:00:28,329 --> 00:00:29,463
- [yells]

18
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:30,664
I suppose there's
some banal excuse

19
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,266
why a month isn't enough time

20
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,834
to get my project shipped
to the Congo?

21
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,137
- Trenton's right.

22
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,138
Encryption keys were exported
 the night of the hack.

23
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,672
Why would Romero do this?

24
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,408
- He did it for the reason
 we need those keys now:

25
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,143
in case our revolution failed.

26
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:44,078
- Bang! [laughs]

27
00:00:44,112 --> 00:00:45,479
- I don't trust him.
 - All of his data's

28
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,548
in the FBI evidence
 storage system.

29
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:50,518
- The FBI. The Dark Army
has a man on the inside.

30
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,486
- I'll hit up my contact.
 - We can't trust them.

31
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,388
- I might have an angle.
 - She was in my home

32
00:00:54,422 --> 00:00:56,390
attempting to steal my badge
 to get on Sentinel.

33
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:59,260
- There are files that can help
decrypt all of E Corp's data.

34
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,461
- What's the plan here?

35
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,562
She talks like she knows
everything.

36
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,331
How do you want to proceed?

37
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,233
- We haven't seen each other
 in months.

38
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,335
We've been battling each other
 in our own voids.

39
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,670
When we were kids, Darlene
and I, we made this snowman.

40
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,640
That was the day my dad
 pushed me out the window.

41
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,409
You remember when we made
Kevin McCallister?

42
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,877
- Do you want to talk about it?

43
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,479
- Do you remember
 when you said

44
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,648
Elliot would one day follow

45
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,251
in the footsteps
 of his father?

46
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,154
I think it's time he died
for us too.

47
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:32,493
[loud thudding]

48
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,300
[ambient music]

49
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:46,374
*

50
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,152
[door opens]

51
00:01:58,186 --> 00:02:00,221
[rustling]

52
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,125
[speaking in Mandarin]

53
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,250
[suspenseful music]

54
00:02:29,283 --> 00:02:35,523

55
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:37,691
[pots clattering]

56
00:02:38,292 --> 00:02:45,333
*

57
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:23,304
- Darlene's not responding
 to any of my texts.

58
00:03:23,337 --> 00:03:24,738
If Dark Army's targeting me,

59
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,707
then they're gonna
 target her next.

60
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,277
Hopefully, she made it
 to our rendezvous.

61
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:36,584
*

62
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,587
[musical intensifies]

63
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,627
*

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,241
[knocks loudly]
- Wake up.

65
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,680
Let's go.
You're coming with me.

66
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,649
- Finally you guys came
to your sen--

67
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,585
[yells] Dude, what the fuck?
- Shut up.

68
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:13,354
- Are you seriously gonna
arrest me right now?

69
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,823
I told you we can
fix this, okay?

70
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,958
Let's just log into Sentinel.
- I said shut the fuck up.

71
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:22,630
- It's the EC and 302 from
last night, the Alderson case.

72
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:24,698
I just submitted it for upload.

73
00:04:24,732 --> 00:04:26,434
- Why are you giving me this?

74
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:29,837
- Um, sorry, Santiago
must not have told you.

75
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,407
You're on the Alderson arrest.
I brought her in last night.

76
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,975
- No clue what
you're talking about.

77
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:36,710
I'm headed to JFK in 20.

78
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,946
Got a flight to San Fran today.

79
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:54,995
*

80
00:05:12,913 --> 00:05:14,047
- Santiago!

81
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:16,717
What are you doing?

82
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,888
- Taking her to holding.

83
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,356
- I thought you were putting
Agent Kaz on this.

84
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,757
Why are you doing
this yourself?

85
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:24,992
- The ADIC wanted her
in holding.

86
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,727
That's what I'm doing.
Get back inside.

87
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,961
- Fine, I'll take it up
with the ADIC then.

88
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:38,038
*

89
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:45,413
Are you gonna finally tell me
what the fuck is going on?

90
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,817
- I can't talk to you
about it, Dom.

91
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,420
You're not authorized to know.

92
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:55,088
There's intel you're not privy
to that's connected to this.

93
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,963
- I'd be more comfortable
if we took it up with the ADIC.

94
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,403
- If you want to call him,
you can.

95
00:06:09,437 --> 00:06:10,438
But I...

96
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:14,808
I just don't want you
to embarrass yourself.

97
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,949
[scoffs] What?

98
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:23,083
Are you scared of me now?

99
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,120
There are cameras everywhere.

100
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,155
You really think I'm going
to do--

101
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,790
[thud]

102
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,502
- She's not here.

103
00:06:43,203 --> 00:06:45,172
Mr. Robot's note.

104
00:06:45,205 --> 00:06:47,808
If what he said is true and
 the Dark Army owns the FBI,

105
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,443
then maybe she ran into them

106
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:51,879
while she was trying
 to access Sentinel.

107
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,118
[dark electronic music]

108
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,820
Shit.

109
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,455
Dark Army has dozens
 of operatives

110
00:07:01,489 --> 00:07:03,156
who live in and around
 Manhattan.

111
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,992
Combing through their command
 and control server

112
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,894
is going to take too long.

113
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,963
There are over 600,000
 compromised systems on here.

114
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:11,932
I can't go through every one.

115
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,767
I don't even know
 what I'm searching for.

116
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,168
I need something to go on.

117
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:18,472
A name, place,
 something, anything.

118
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,142
Think, think, think.
 What do I know?

119
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,144
Anything you can remember?
 Any detail?

120
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:26,079
Anything. Tell me something.

121
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,949
Don't you get it?
 She's gonna die.

122
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,118
Darlene's gonna die.
 She's gonna die.

123
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,986
She's gonna fucking die
 like everyone else.

124
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,788
[glass shatters]

125
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:37,057

*

129
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:55,509
I should have never done this.

130
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,244
I should have left this alone.

131
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:59,246
I'll never learn.

132
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:01,982
I brought this on myself.

133
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,051
I'll never learn.

134
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:09,056
This is on me.

135
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:15,929
*

136
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:17,230
This is on me.

137
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:26,206
- For how many?

138
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,908
- One.

139
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,076
[machinery whirring]

140
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:32,946
- So, Ferris wheel.

141
00:08:34,582 --> 00:08:36,283
Cute touch.

142
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,053
- I need information from you.

143
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:43,090
- You do not get to summon me
like you're Ali Baba,

144
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,258
squeeze me for information then
shove me back in some lamp.

145
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:47,094
- Darlene's in trouble!

146
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,629
She might already be dead.

147
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,330
- The whole reason you're
in this goddamn mess

148
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,032
is because we're
not working together,

149
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,167
because you refuse
to talk to me.

150
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,235
- I wish that were true.

151
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,239
The sick part is...

152
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,277
I actually missed you.

153
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,584
The only reason
we haven't been talking...

154
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:17,591
Is because I haven't
let myself.

155
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,326
'Cause I've been scared of you.

156
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:26,199
The part of...me that is you.

[tense music]

00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:32,673

*

160
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,615
- The 71 buildings.

161
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,618
- I didn't know about that.

162
00:09:46,186 --> 00:09:49,156
- If you did,
would you have done it?

163
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:54,161
Would you have done it?

164
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,363
- I would have...

165
00:09:59,967 --> 00:10:03,103
I would have found another way.

166
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:13,246
- Because as much as there
is a part of you in me...

167
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:16,349
there is a part of me in you.

168
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,095
Your note on the mirror,
what did you mean by it?

169
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:35,068
What do you know?

170
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,204
I need to find Darlene.

171
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,673
Tell me what you know.

172
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:42,275
- The FBI...

173
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,311
has a mole.

174
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:48,381
[thunder booming]

175
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:55,388
- [sighs]

176
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,049
You piece of shit.

177
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,355
The attack in China.

178
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:33,761
While you were hiding
in your room,

179
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:37,130
knowing the rest of us
were getting blown to pieces.

180
00:11:38,165 --> 00:11:40,100
Cisco.

181
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:45,438
You helped them get to him
before we did, didn't you?

182
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:52,846
And the Tyrell cover-up.

183
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,248
You helped frame...

184
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,751
Markesh and Biswas.

185
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:04,892
This whole time, we've been
punching ourselves in the face

186
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:07,795
because of you!

187
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,529
- All I know is, if you were
put in my position--

188
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,466
- Nothing would make me betray
everything I stand for.

189
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,270
- You know one thing I'll say
about you, DiPierro,

190
00:12:17,304 --> 00:12:19,840
your naiveté is adorable.

191
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,875
It's easy for you to play
a hero in the back seat,

192
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,177
but that's all world's ever
amounted to.

193
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:26,279
The back seat.

194
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:27,848
The things I did.

195
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:30,117
I mean, the--the things
that I have to do--

196
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,819
- Are you seriously trying
to paint yourself a saint now

197
00:12:31,852 --> 00:12:33,553
after what you've put us
through?

198
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:35,789
- You know, the only reason
your girlfriend here is alive

199
00:12:35,823 --> 00:12:38,525
is because I never told the
Dark Army she was a CHS.

200
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:42,395
Believe or not,
I'm not a bad guy, DiPierro.

201
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,799
You don't understand
what they put me through.

202
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,202
What they hold over me,
but you will.

203
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,537
Soon enough.

204
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,139
[thunder rumbling]

205
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:53,540
[tense music]

206
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:55,275
- There's the cocksucker.

207
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,477
Dead center.

208
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,212
According to Wellick,

209
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:00,948
he's been working both sides
the whole time.

210
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,917
Probably the reason we didn't
get pegged for Five/Nine.

211
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,888
- We gotta find a way
to trace him.

212
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,223
- Why don't we jump
on his desktop?

213
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:12,359
- I already did that remotely,
nothing useful.

214
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,930
Which means whatever
we're looking for is physical.

215
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:24,137
*

216
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,214
Number sets.

217
00:13:34,247 --> 00:13:35,482
It's another cipher code.

218
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,350
- Not this shit again.

219
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:38,919
- This has gotta give us
a location.

220
00:13:38,952 --> 00:13:40,921
- [sighs]

221
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:46,159
Elliot.
- Just give me a minute.

222
00:13:46,193 --> 00:13:47,260
- Elliot.

223
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,296
- Just finished this book.

224
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,236
I got it on tape.

225
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,306
[chuckles] Didn't care much
for the ending.

226
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,942
I mean, a story can have
a mediocre beginning

227
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,477
and middle,
and oftentimes it does,

228
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,513
but always got to have
a wow ending.

229
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,349
Otherwise, what's the point?

230
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:10,984
- Shit.

231
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,553
If he's here that means
 they must have Darlene.

232
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,989
Maybe I can manipulate him
 into helping us.

233
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,424
Quick.

234
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,027
What do we know about--
- Whatever scheme

235
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,330
you're trying to come up
with right now

236
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,934
It ain't gonna change
the inevitable, so...

237
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:29,369
I strongly recommend
you choose the easy way here

238
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,504
and come with me.

239
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,943
[thunder rumbling]

240
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,949
[knocking, door clicks opens]

241
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:48,488
- How'd you sleep last night?

242
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:51,058
- I didn't.

243
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:53,526
I've been waiting all night.

244
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,963
I need to see her
as soon as possible.

245
00:14:55,996 --> 00:14:58,298
I have important information
for her.

246
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,402
- It's a beautiful day,
don't you think?

247
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,238
[thunder rumbling]

248
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,009
- Look.

249
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:15,615
There are people
that are trying to stop her.

250
00:15:15,648 --> 00:15:17,484
I need to tell her.

251
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,519
- Oh, I'm just
the house manager.

252
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:23,323
But you can discuss that with
Mr. Price when he arrives.

253
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:25,592
I thought we'd get some
breakfast first.

254
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:32,966
Do you like pancakes?

255
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,339
[chilling electronic music]

256
00:15:39,372 --> 00:15:46,413
*

257
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,041
- It's this way.

258
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:22,049
*

259
00:16:29,122 --> 00:16:30,323
[music fades]

260
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,600
- Elliot.
- Don't fucking move.

261
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,077
- We are walking into some
fucking hillbilly shit here.

262
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54,714
- Now, look.

263
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,750
I know this is all fucked up,
but it's salvageable.

264
00:16:57,784 --> 00:16:59,519
There's a lot of clean-up
at the FBI

265
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,154
you're going to have
to take care of for me.

266
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,355
- Mm-hmm.

267
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:07,494
So this is the plus-one
you've been squawking about?

268
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:09,662
- [scoffs]

269
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,731
You're not turning this
around on me.

270
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,700
Not after the fucking day
I've had,

271
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,503
cleaning up your mess
once again.

272
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,838
I'm over it.
[yelling] You hear me?

273
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,607
It's high time you guys start

274
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,743
cleaning up my mess
for a change.

275
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,113
- Uh-huh.

276
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:29,449
And by "mess" I assume
you mean her.

277
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,454
*

278
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:36,623
- I know how to fix this.

279
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,790
- So do I.

280
00:17:39,826 --> 00:17:41,828
[sighs]

281
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,763
All right.

282
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,099
Come on, Miss, let's go.

283
00:17:55,808 --> 00:18:02,815
*

284
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,522
Leon, you got this?

285
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,424
- Yeah, I got it.

286
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:21,834
*

287
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,180
- Are you okay?

288
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:35,548
- Is that a joke?

289
00:18:35,582 --> 00:18:37,850
We're in a fucking barn out
in the middle of nowhere

290
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:39,819
with a handful
of psychos.

291
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,555
"No" is the answer.

292
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,526
- Listen, sir.

293
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,928
I don't know what you think
I did, but...

294
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,531
This guy's a liability to you.
He's gotten sloppy.

295
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,166
You don't have to do this.
- Dom.

296
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,867
- My bosses know
about everything.

297
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,204
There's security camera footage
of him kidnapping

298
00:18:57,237 --> 00:18:58,538
Ms. Alderson and me--
- Miss.

299
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,141
Stop talking.

300
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:04,811
Hm?

301
00:19:06,913 --> 00:19:14,153
*

302
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,233
- Okay, we got two operatives.

303
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,601
Leon's pretty good
with a knife.

304
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:32,205
What are you thinking?

305
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,508
- I'm not trying to escape.

306
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:38,245
- Elliot, these guys aren't
fucking around.

307
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:39,912
Who do you think you're going
to talk to out here?

308
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:42,815
- Who do you think?

309
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,517
Whiterose.

310
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:47,654
- You've played
that game already.

311
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,856
She doesn't want to see you.

312
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,529
- She's seeing us right now.

313
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:02,201
*

314
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:08,908
- [breathing heavily]

315
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:09,942
Fuck me.

316
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:17,650
*

317
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:19,586
- Now wait a minute.

318
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:20,753
Let's just slow things
down a bit.

319
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,255
We can flip her.

320
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,723
She can be very valuable.

321
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,358
- No way I'm flipping.
- Dom.

322
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,859
Don't be stupid.
Listen to me.

323
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,661
I'm trying to get you out
of this alive.

324
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,631
- Valuable, huh?

325
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,800
You think she would've gone far
in the Bureau?

326
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,902
- She would have been one
of the youngest ASACs ever,

327
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:36,903
still could be.

328
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:39,272
No, she's a rising star.

329
00:20:40,707 --> 00:20:43,276
*

330
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,977
- Gumption.

331
00:20:45,011 --> 00:20:47,747
- [crying]

332
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,783
- But it's like she said,

333
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,352
no way she's flipping.

334
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,753
- [startled gasp]

335
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:54,954
[panting]

336
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:56,789
- Hey.

337
00:20:56,823 --> 00:21:00,393
Oh, no, no, don't get
too worked up, Miss.

338
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,595
Just look at the sky.

339
00:21:03,863 --> 00:21:06,399
Take a deep breath.

340
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:08,067
Try to enjoy the fresh air.

341
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,337
- [whimpering]

342
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,872
[wind rustling]

343
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,809
[inhales]

344
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:17,977
- [exhales]

345
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,779
- Wait, wait, wait. Dom.

346
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:21,381
Just tell him you'll flip.

347
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,983
[both breathing slowly]

348
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,652
- This isn't worth it.
You can--

349
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,387
- [grunting]

350
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:35,362
[grunts]

351
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,729
- [gasps]

352
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:39,632
- [coughing]

353
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,446
- Oh, don't mind that.

354
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,884
We're retiring this shit-stain.

355
00:21:57,917 --> 00:22:00,787
And you're taking his place.

356
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,055
You work for the Dark Army now.

357
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:06,993
You're gonna go back
to the FBI.

358
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:09,829
It's gonna be business
as usual.

359
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:11,764
You're gonna feed us
any information

360
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,766
and answer all our requests.

361
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,804
- Fuck you.
- Now, Dom.

362
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:20,006
You're gonna need
to get your head

363
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,908
around the position
you're in here.

364
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:24,076
- I'm no traitor.

365
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,878
You should kill me now

366
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,780
because the first thing I do

367
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:30,082
when you let me go is arrest
your fucking ass.

368
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,921
- [sniffles]

369
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:40,393
The name of your youngest
family member,

370
00:22:40,427 --> 00:22:42,829
what is it?

371
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,432
[tense music]

372
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,435
Oh, that's right.

373
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:53,005
Four-year-old Jamie DiPierro
of Morrisville.

374
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,843
That's your brother
Joseph's kid, right?

375
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,711
*

376
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,913
Yeah.

377
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:05,452
I want you to look
at this jerk-off

378
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:08,120
and imagine it's little Jamie.

379
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:10,089
[panting]

383
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:23,069

your mom Trudie...

Now imagine Uncle Chris
one morning

387
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,545
as he's picking up his copy...

388
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:35,147
[yelling]
of the "Dallas Morning Star"!

00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:43,222
- Or you're older brother,
Jerry,

391
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,024
while he's watching

392
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:48,495
"Wheel...of...Fortune!"

393

- [breathing heavily]

395
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:01,107
Am I illustrating my point?

396
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,846
[yelling] Dom, I'm going
to need verbal confirmation

397
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:10,517
that you're grasping the
details of this agreement!

398
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,985
- [sobbing]

399
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,987
Okay.

400
00:24:15,021 --> 00:24:17,456
Okay.

401
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,497
- In time...

402
00:24:24,531 --> 00:24:27,634
this will get easier
to live with.

403
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:29,936
I promise.

404
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:34,173
Head into the barn
and await further instructions

405
00:24:34,206 --> 00:24:36,142
on how to clear up
Santiago's missteps.

406
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,916
Now, forgive me

407
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,252
while I take a moment
to center myself.

408

[inhales deeply]

00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,895
This next bunch...

411
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,297
These are for me.

412
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,298

[fly buzzing]

417
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,666
- Jesus, Dom, what happened?

418
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,535
- Looks like she's just got
her initiation.

419
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:41,641
Want some of this catnip, girl?

420
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:48,147
All right.
Suit yourself.

421
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,350
- All right, if we don't figure
out a way get out of here,

422
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,953
they are going to kill us.

423
00:25:53,986 --> 00:25:56,656
- Look around you.

424
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,891
They've been instructed
to wait.

425
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:00,192
Not act.

426
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,929
- Wait for what?

427
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,300
- They're preparing for someone
important to come.

428
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:11,704
[ominous jazz music]

[music stops abruptly]

435
00:27:01,353 --> 00:27:03,222
- I took care of everything.

436
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:05,658
As instructed.

437
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,660
Everyone's loaded up
in the barn.

438
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:10,963
You might want
to send your guys

439
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:13,099
to the woodpile over there.

440
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,672
I had to kill the FBI mole.

441
00:27:19,706 --> 00:27:21,340
That's the bad news.

442
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,210
Good news, I got you someone
even better.

443
00:27:24,243 --> 00:27:25,712
She doesn't have as high
of a rank,

444
00:27:25,745 --> 00:27:28,147
but she's got
tremendous upside.

445
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,682
Besides...

446
00:27:29,716 --> 00:27:32,151
That guy was a dickhead.

447
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:33,219
Anyway.

448
00:27:34,453 --> 00:27:36,022
She's in the barn as well.

449
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:41,260
- Where are you going?

450
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:43,195
- Me, I'm gonna take
that overdue sabbatical

451
00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:45,331
I keep talking about.

452
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:48,334
Finally get to finish my book.

453
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,436
Well, that's the goal anyway.

454
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,739
I'm thinking the Sandals
in Barbados.

455
00:27:52,772 --> 00:27:55,007
They got a good special running
this month.

456
00:27:55,041 --> 00:27:57,243
- You are not going anywhere.

457
00:27:57,276 --> 00:27:59,812
We have work to do.

461
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:21,067
She still making
her spontaneous overtures?

462
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:28,040
She make you taste her yet?

463
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:30,743
Remember, doll face,

464
00:28:30,777 --> 00:28:33,512
I was you years ago.

465
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,315
And I've already done my time.

466
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,054
I think she'll be good with me.

467
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,297
Glad we did this.

468
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,103
- [speaks Mandarin]

469
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:03,209
- I want to leave.

470
00:29:03,242 --> 00:29:07,346
- My staff not keeping
you comfortable?

471
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,182
- I wouldn't have come

472
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,318
if I had known
this was your house.

473
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,321
- I was getting concerned
about you.

474
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,823
Hadn't been to work for weeks,

475
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:20,793
you're not answering
your phone, your emails.

476
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:23,229
I sent someone
to your apartment.

477
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:28,534
When I saw what you were doing,
I felt I...

478
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:31,137
I had to intervene.

479
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:34,140
[tense music]

[door shuts]

482
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,522
- I'm not supposed to be here.

483
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:53,926
- And where do you think
you're supposed to be?

484
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,295
- You know where.

485
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,363
With her.

486
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,133
She has a plan.

487
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:06,906
- Yes, I've known about
her delusional plan for years.

488
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,843
- You don't know anything.

489
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:12,511
- Mr. Alderson.

490
00:30:12,544 --> 00:30:15,247
I had a chance to review
your paperwork for Stage Three.

491
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,483
Surprisingly--
- It's bullshit.

492
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:20,552
There is no Stage Three,
but you already knew that.

493
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,157
- I'm glad we can be honest.

494
00:30:25,191 --> 00:30:26,959
Now we can talk.

495
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,862
- The only reason
you're involved in any of this

496
00:30:29,896 --> 00:30:32,865
is because I had Colby
hire you.

497
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:36,635
I needed to manipulate you
into dropping

498
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,171
that contingency
from your lawsuit.

499
00:30:39,205 --> 00:30:41,373
You were threatening her plant.

500
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,009
And she would have
done anything

501
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,276
to stop those inspections,

502
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:47,947
including killing you.

503
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,616
- Why would you care
if she killed me?

504
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,552
You don't care about anyone
but yourself.

505
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,487
- Let go of them.

506
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,489
Then we can talk.

507
00:30:57,523 --> 00:30:59,892
- But if I didn't have her

508
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:03,329
then how am I going
to keep you honest?

509
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,565
- I own everything.

510
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:10,402
I own every single system
the Dark Army has compromised.

511
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:17,476
*

512
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,282
- I met your mother.

513
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:26,485
Emily.

514
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,556
32 years ago.

515
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,424
- When you took my laptop,

516
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:35,694
you infected yourself
with my malware.

517
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,663
If you hurt her,

518
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,631
it will all get released.

519
00:31:39,665 --> 00:31:43,602
Every bribe, blackmail,
extortion, operation,

520
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,471
all your illegal connections,

521
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,339
everything will go public.

522
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:50,342
The entire Dark Army history.

523
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,480
- [chuckles]

524
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:59,051
That's impossible.

525
00:31:59,085 --> 00:32:02,288
And here I thought
we were going to be honest.

526
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:04,623
- We were both working
 at E Corp.

527
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:08,627
We dated for quite some time.

528
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,629
- Seven days ago,
the Russian government

529
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:12,364
hired you to hack
the DNC.

530
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:14,500
- Elliot.
- Two days before that,

531
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,702
you bribed the president of
South Korea to allow backdoors

532
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:18,604
in all
of their military networks.

533
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:21,040
- You're just pissing him off.
- Three weeks before that,

534
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:24,543
you used Phillip Price
to annex the Congo for China.

535
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:31,083
Am I being more honest now?

536
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:32,384
- I loved her.

537
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:37,389
Deeply.

538
00:32:37,423 --> 00:32:39,992
But I never told her.

539
00:32:40,026 --> 00:32:44,330
- If one of us dies,
everything gets leaked.

540
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:48,567
- Well, we can survive a leak.

541
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,071
You can't survive a bullet
through your throat.

542
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:54,373
- The closer we became,
the more I held back.

543
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:56,742
I was cruel to her

544
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:58,544
in that way.

545
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:01,013
It made me feel strong...

546
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:06,485
To torture her like that--
like that.

547
00:33:07,586 --> 00:33:09,688
- We have an opportunity
for both of us

548
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,325
to leave with what we want.
- I know exactly what you want.

549
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,361
You want to reverse Five/Nine.

550
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:20,132
And honestly we couldn't
care less about that.

551
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:23,035
It's already served
its purpose.

552
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:26,705
- When she told me
she was pregnant,

553
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:30,042
she was very emphatic
that her child

554
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:32,544
wasn't going to

missing your deadlines,
doing nothing,

563
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,732
I've engineered a hack that
can solve all of your problems

564
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,634
and I'm willing
to give it to you.

I can move your projects
to the Congo!

Who agreed to raise you
as his own.

You are just one hacker.

What makes you believe
that you are better

575

than an army of people
exactly like you?

what whiterose had done to you.

what she's talking about.

Angela, this so-called project
of hers,

585
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:59,698
it stems from an obsessive,
psychotic denial of reality.

You're good at playing games.

the wrong hand to play.

ridiculous fantasy.

Romero was just spying on us.

He caught someone else
exporting the key data.

The snowman.

When we were in Coney Island,
you asked me if I remembered.

What was that all about?
It felt so random.

724
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:07,072
- That was the day Dad
pushed me out the window.

- What are you--
what do you mean...

726
00:45:14,279 --> 00:45:17,282
Dad pushed you out the window?

727
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:21,086
- He was mad that I told Mom
about his cancer,

728
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,890
and he pushed me
out the window.

729

00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,765

For some reason

00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:44,309
you freaked out and told me
to go hid in the closet.

737
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:47,345
Then Dad came in the room,

you--I don't know.

70
00:08:25,592 --> 00:08:27,115
And the fact thatthis is coinciding

71
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:30,553
with Phillip Price'sabrupt resignation request?

72
00:08:30,597 --> 00:08:34,514
Well, it's like you always say:

73
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,778
There is no such thingas a coincidence.

74
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,608
- Very well.

75
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:45,394
Refuse Price's demands
and keep on digging.

76
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,830
Additionally,

77
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:49,964
keep constant surveillance
on Elliot Alderson.

78
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:54,795

Minister Zhang.

79
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:57,624
It will just require
some patience.

80
00:14:40,836 --> 00:14:42,359
No.

81
00:14:44,187 --> 00:14:46,189

82
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,017
Did you say something?

83
00:14:52,239 --> 00:14:54,676
- Give Phillip Price
what he wants.

84
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:57,026
- I'm sorry?

85
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,724
- Let him know that we will
arrange a Deus Group meeting

86
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,161
to confirm a successor.

87
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:02,466

88
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,728

89
00:15:03,772 --> 00:15:05,121
- Tomorrow?

90
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:08,516
- If there's one way
to disrupt a man's plans,

91
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,911
it is to destabilize
his timeline.

92
00:15:11,954 --> 00:15:13,956
If they are indeed planning
something together,

93
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,917
we will not wait for them
to make a mistake.

94
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,571
We will force them into one.

95
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,312
- Tomorrow's Christmas Day.

96
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:23,705
There's no way we'll be able

97
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,881
to get the Deus Group together
so quickly.

98
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,493
- I have been trying to ship
my project to the Congo

99
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:33,149
for the last 302 daysand counting.

100
00:15:33,193 --> 00:15:36,544
Anything that will disrupt that
will no longer be tolerated.

101
00:15:36,587 --> 00:15:40,765
I have officially
run out of patience.

102
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:44,508
- This rash behavior willonly come back to haunt you.

103
00:15:44,552 --> 00:15:47,990
When Phillip Price resigns,
you will have no CEO at E Corp.

104
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,035
- Wellick.

105
00:15:50,688 --> 00:15:52,429
- I'm sorry?

106
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:57,173
- Call Mr. Wellick andoffer him the CEO position.

107
00:15:57,217 --> 00:16:01,351
Tell him you are speaking
for Whiterose.

108
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:05,051
I have no doubt
that he will accept.

109
00:16:31,164 --> 00:16:32,992
- You ever play
Russian Roulette?

110
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:35,864
They say once you pull
that trigger, it changes you

111
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,474
and you can't go back
to who you were

112
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,737
before you heard
that infamous click,

113
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:42,044
the sound of cheating death.

114
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:44,960
We've been lucky so far,
but I can't shake the feeling

115
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,396
that there's a barrel
pointed at us

116
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,484
and we're
running out of chances

117
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:50,052
to get that empty chamber.

118
00:16:50,096 --> 00:16:52,141
I'm not sure what's taking
Vera so long to come at us

119
00:16:52,185 --> 00:16:54,274
with bullets fully loaded.

120
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,058
Every time I try
to talk to Elliot about it,

121
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:57,886
he puts up a wall,

122
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,802
like he's flat-out
throwing me a forbidden error,

123
00:17:00,845 --> 00:17:04,458
denying me the chance
to even bring it up.

124
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:06,808
But Vera's gonna find us
sooner or later,

125
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:09,245
and I just hope we see him
coming when he does.

126
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,428
- Oh, shit.

127
00:17:18,472 --> 00:17:20,082
- Krista.

128
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:23,520
- Uh, give me a second.

129
00:17:23,564 --> 00:17:24,521
- Sure.

130
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,569
- I've tried calling you.

131
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,266
- Elliot, I thoughtI made myself clear.

132
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:32,442
- Yeah, I got your letter.

133
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:34,183
I--I just wanted
to talk to you.

134
00:17:34,227 --> 00:17:35,750
- You know that can't happen.

135
00:17:35,793 --> 00:17:37,882
I explained that in the letteras politely as I could.

136
00:17:37,926 --> 00:17:40,276
- You don't understand.
I'm--I'm doing better.

137
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,626
I'm finally talking
to Mr. Robot

138
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,803
just like
you always said I should.

139
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:47,501
- We cannot have contactanymore.

140
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:48,806
Do you understand that?

141
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,286
- I just want you to know

142
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:52,636
that I'm finally making
some real progress.

143
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,465
- I don't feel safe around you!

144
00:18:09,305 --> 00:18:11,829
Leave me alone.

145
00:18:11,873 --> 00:18:14,876
Or I'll be forced
to take legal action.

146
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,230
- I wasn't asking you
to treat me again.

147
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:24,103
I just wanted to say thank you
for helping me.

148
00:18:31,936 --> 00:18:32,850
- You okay?

149
00:18:35,592 --> 00:18:36,724
- Yeah.

150
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,613
- Olivia Cortez
was Susan Jacobs's contact

151
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,485
at Cyprus National Bank.

152
00:18:58,528 --> 00:19:01,052
She's the Deus Group'sonly U.S. account manager

153
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:02,315
since they wantto make their presence here

154
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,491
as minimal as possible.

155
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:06,928
She's our way in.

156
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:11,454
- I don't see any
Cyprus National Bank accounts.

157
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:14,936
- Yeah, these banks make theirlackeys use on-prem work boxes

158
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,895
that are closed loop and nearimpossible to exploit remotely.

159
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:21,856
We'll have to getphysical access to her laptop.

160
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:27,557
Kinda makes sense.

161
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:29,168
- What?

162
00:19:29,211 --> 00:19:31,213
- That you made this your HQ.

163
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,954
It's where it all started.

164
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,912
No better place to planhow it'll end.

165
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:40,266
- It's just an abandoned office
I knew had a 10-gig fiber link.

166
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,745
- Please.

167
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,704
I know you have a soft spotfor this nerd factory.

168
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,534
Where are you going?

169
00:19:48,752 --> 00:19:50,885
- Olivia's iCal says

170
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:54,236
her ex-husband's got her kid
tonight and she's got a date.

171
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,585
Should give me enough time

172
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:57,152
to check out her place
and get on her machine.

173
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,588
- Whoa.

174
00:19:58,632 --> 00:20:00,721
You think I'm your
little research monkey?

175
00:20:01,678 --> 00:20:03,680
We agreed
I'd handle the bank contact

176
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,856
and you'd deal
with the SS7 license.

177
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,251
- That was before I knewwe needed physical access.

178
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:10,470
Now you're gonna stay here

179
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:12,167
and get thecell service permissions.

180
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,517
No, thanks.

181
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:16,824
I'm gonna stick with the plan.

182
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:18,652
You can spend
your Christmas Eve here

183
00:20:18,695 --> 00:20:19,870
watching rats fuck.

184
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:22,438
I'm gonna go out
and do this B&E.

185
00:20:22,482 --> 00:20:24,397
- Will you talk some senseinto her?

186
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:28,531
- Darlene...

187
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,577
this is not yourrun-of-the-mill break-in.

188
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,840
This is a Deus Group contact.

189
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:35,930
- Yeah, I get it, dude.
It's dangerous.

190
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:38,628
Okay, you know this whole
protective older brother act's

191
00:20:38,672 --> 00:20:40,935
gotten beyond lame.

192
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,676
- I'm telling you,this is too--

193
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:44,112
- Risky?

194
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:46,245
Perilous?
Treacherous?

195
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:53,730
Hazardous to my health?

196
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,738
What the fuck
do you think you're doing?

197
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:03,131
- You're not going.

198
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,219
- You're hurting me.

199
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,264
- I know.

200
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,658
- Is this you, or--

201
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:10,704
- It's me.

202
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,318
- What's happening to you?

203
00:21:16,362 --> 00:21:18,407
- You wanted to work with me.

204
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,453
This is the way it is.

205
00:21:20,496 --> 00:21:23,107
If there's a problem,
don't be here when I get back.

206
00:21:25,545 --> 00:21:28,417
- And here I thought things
were better after yesterday.

207
00:21:28,461 --> 00:21:29,984
But as per usual,

208
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:33,248
it's one step forward
and four fucking leaps back.

209
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,560
Nothing's ever gonna change
with you, is it?

210
00:21:42,823 --> 00:21:44,912
- No, it's not.

211
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:54,008
I should've never
opened my door

212
00:21:54,051 --> 00:21:56,271
when you came back into town.

213
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,373
- There's no word for it,
you know?

214
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,514
There's "orphan,"
"widow," "widower."

215
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:26,301
So what do you call someone
who's lost everyone?

216
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:33,874
Mom, dad, sister,
girlfriend, friends.

217
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,484
A survivor?

218
00:22:35,528 --> 00:22:39,358
Or a walking time bomb?

219
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:43,100
Elliot thinks the more he
restricts everyone's access,

220
00:22:43,144 --> 00:22:46,495
the less vulnerable he'll be.

221
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,889
But there's a trade-off
that he's forgetting.

222
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,281
If you block everyone,

223
00:22:50,325 --> 00:22:51,892
then what's
the point of being here?

224
00:22:51,935 --> 00:22:54,198
Of doing all this?

225
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,635
Of existing?

226
00:22:55,678 --> 00:22:58,507
- I'm that's her personal,
but check it anyway.

227
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:38,912
- There's nothing
on Cyprus National Bank,

228
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:40,261
but I've learned more
than I want to know

229
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,655
about this Evan dude
she's on a date with.

230
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,744
His name is Evan,
for fuck's sake.

231
00:25:02,849 --> 00:25:05,591
He's into snowboarding,
social media influencing,

232
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:07,593
and Reiki.

233
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:10,552
Classic Evan.

234
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:12,989
What'd you find?

235
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,600
- That.

236
00:25:14,643 --> 00:25:16,906
We got her credentials,
but without her security fob,

237
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,518
we don't have shit.

238
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:21,302
- You check the closet.I'll take the nightstand.

239
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:23,434
- She'll have it on her.
It's bank protocol.

240
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:25,001
- How do you know she doesn'tget sloppy sometimes

241
00:25:25,045 --> 00:25:26,350
and leave it behind?

242
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,962
- You read the same shit on her
I did.

243
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:31,138
She's a single mom who spent
three years in night school

244
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,009
to get this job.

245
00:25:33,053 --> 00:25:34,707
Someone like that
isn't going to risk

246
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:37,623
the best gig they've ever had
by being sloppy.

247
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:39,494
- So we install a listeneron her machine,

248
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,539
wait for her to log in.

249
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:41,757
- It's the holidays.

250
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,716
She isn't
logging in anytime soon.

251
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:45,021
And even if she did,

252
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:48,068
we'd only got 60 seconds
to swipe the code.

253
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,853
- Okay. We phish her,get her to log in,

254
00:25:50,897 --> 00:25:52,551
catch the RSA code then.

255
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:53,595
We're all good.

256
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:55,728
- If she doesn't take the bait?

257
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,469
We don't have time
to chance it.

258
00:25:58,513 --> 00:26:01,168
- Well, if you have any ideas,I'm all fucking ears.

259
00:26:31,111 --> 00:26:33,200
- Looks like he stood her up.

260
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:40,729
Okay, she's leaving.

261
00:26:40,773 --> 00:26:42,601
Let's go back and regroup.

262
00:26:42,644 --> 00:26:46,213
- I found a bottle of oxy
in her apartment.

263
00:26:46,256 --> 00:26:47,214
- So?

264
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:53,873
- She's an addict who's
supposedly gone straight.

265
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:55,657
Custody agreement says

266
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:58,747
if she gets caught using again,
she loses her kid.

267
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:04,623
- So what do you want to dowith that information, exactly?

268
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,801
- You know how this works.

269
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,672
- Hang on, kiddo.
- What for?

270
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:12,631
- Why don't you trya little small talk?

271
00:27:12,674 --> 00:27:14,545
Keep her here for a while,grab the fob,

272
00:27:14,589 --> 00:27:15,808
and then punch in the code.

273
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,245
- No. There's no time
for small talk.

274
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:19,725
Not when we already own her.

275
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:35,218
I'm sorry.

276
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:39,135
- Excuse me?

277
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:41,224
- You're gonna want
to sit back down.

278
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:44,314
What are you talking about?

279
00:27:44,358 --> 00:27:45,881
- 'Cause I'm gonna
buy you a drink.

280
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:50,712
- I'm sorry, do I know you?

281
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,714
- This is a waste of time
we don't have.

282
00:27:52,758 --> 00:27:53,933
- I'm Elliot.

283
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,064
Now you know me.

284
00:27:58,459 --> 00:28:00,679
- I'm gonna take off, actually.It's been a long day.

285
00:28:00,722 --> 00:28:03,203
- Okay. I'll come clean.

286
00:28:03,246 --> 00:28:04,987
I couldn't help but notice
you were stood up.

287
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:07,511
- Now,
it's none of my business,

288
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:08,991
but the guy's clearly
a sack of shit

289
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:10,210
to leave you alone
on Christmas Eve,

290
00:28:10,253 --> 00:28:11,994
and if you'd let me,

291
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,344
I'd like to apologize for those
of us who have done you wrong

292
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:16,042
by buying you a drink.

293
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,003
- Another round?

294
00:28:29,185 --> 00:28:30,099
- Why not?

295
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:33,059
It's Christmas.

296
00:28:34,277 --> 00:28:35,496
- You're on, kiddo.

297
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,444
- There you go, Juanito.

298
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,751
Tell your mama
I packed it special for her.

299
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:13,795
Merry Xmas.

300
00:29:36,035 --> 00:29:38,298
Tell me you brought tidings
of joy about my dude Elliot.

301
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,344
- Come on, bruh.

302
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:43,694
What was so important about
this motherfucker, anyway?

303
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,436
- You know why
we came back here, right?

304
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,050
Well, do you?

305
00:29:51,093 --> 00:29:52,921
- So you could be
king of New York.

306
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,575
- And in order
for our kingdom to be built,

307
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:55,576
I need a brilliant...

308
00:29:55,619 --> 00:29:57,578
- Architect. I know.

309
00:29:57,621 --> 00:29:58,797
- Yeah, see?
You totally get it.

310
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,233
You just be
selling yourself short.

311
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:05,238
- Hey, listen here, bruh.

312
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:07,414
Look, I may not be
no architect,

313
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,458
but let me tell you something:

314
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,765
I'm loyal--to the bone.

315
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,985
So let me just get my gun,
put it to his head,

316
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:14,421
and make him give you
what the fuck you want.

317
00:30:14,464 --> 00:30:16,249
- How many times
I gotta explain it?

318
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,514
I don't want Elliot
to be my prisoner.

319
00:30:20,557 --> 00:30:22,211
A visionary like him
don't work like that.

320
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:24,823
I want him to be my partner!

321
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:29,828
Now, reflect...

322
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:31,568
and give me something
I can use.

323
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:32,613
- Come on, bruh.

324
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,658
This kid is aloof.

325
00:30:34,702 --> 00:30:36,747
I may be able to catch him
around his hood sometimes,

326
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,140
but for the most part,

327
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:41,013
he riding solo
and giving up nothing.

328
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,362
- What do you mean,
"for the most part"?

329
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:47,019
Well, see?

330
00:30:47,062 --> 00:30:49,760
You gotta be more detailed.
The devil is in that shit.

331
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,285
- Well, look. I--

332
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:53,677
I did see him arguing
with this lady, all right?

333
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,027
And she seemed pretty mad.

334
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:57,725
- Mad how?
- I don't know. Mad.

335
00:30:57,768 --> 00:30:59,466
- Details, bro.

336
00:30:59,509 --> 00:31:02,164
Be specific.Was she crying?

337
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,123
Was--was her nipples hard?

338
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,952
Did a vein pop outof her forehead?

339
00:31:06,995 --> 00:31:08,388
Man, make the connection.

340
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:16,048
Tell me you at least
took some fucking pics.

341
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,876
- Really, man?
Of--of course.

342
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,356
I got you.
Look. Right there.

343
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:24,926
You see?
She's pissed.

344
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,493
So what?

345
00:31:26,536 --> 00:31:28,582
Look bro, we're wasting
our time with this.

346
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:31,585
I mean, we took the risk
to get back here.

347
00:31:31,628 --> 00:31:34,675
I mean, shit, we might as well
put it to good use, fam.

348
00:31:36,546 --> 00:31:37,591
- Hey, kid.

349
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:51,039
Tell me what you see.

350
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,263
- He feels bad
because she's yelling,

351
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,265
like when my mama's mean to me.

352
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:00,614
It makes me sad,

353
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:01,920
like him.

354
00:32:10,363 --> 00:32:12,800
- How come this fuckin' little
kid sees it and you don't?

355
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:17,587
- This ain't about her.

356
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:20,939
Her anger legit.

357
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:24,420
No doubt, the shit
you need to see is on him.

358
00:32:24,464 --> 00:32:26,901
- She hurt him.

359
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:31,601
Not no superficial pain,
neither, we talking...

360
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,342
stab-in-your-heart kind.

361
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,739
- She our girl.

362
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,134
She knows something
I gotta know.

363
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,921
Sorry, bruh.

364
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:49,054
I guess I just need someone
a little more detail-oriented.

365
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,635
- So, uh,

366
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,031
we already know why I'm hereon Christmas Eve.

367
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,685
What's your sob story?

368
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,342
- I don't know. I--

369
00:33:16,385 --> 00:33:19,127
I guess I don't have
anywhere else to be.

370
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:21,129
- No family?

371
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:26,004
- My sister and I
got into a big fight.

372
00:33:26,047 --> 00:33:28,267
My mom died yesterday.

373
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,139
- Oh, my God.

374
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:34,229
I'm so sorry.

375
00:33:36,927 --> 00:33:37,841
- For what?

376
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,282
- For your...

377
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:45,806
you know, that thing
about your mom dying?

378
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:50,071
- Oh.

379
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,160
No. We weren't that close.

380
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:03,128
- Yeah, I kind of have
the same deal with my dad.

381
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:05,782
I mean,
we used to be pretty tight.

382
00:34:05,826 --> 00:34:08,872
But not as close
as my mom and me.

383
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:10,135
She was amazing.

384
00:34:13,138 --> 00:34:15,357
She died too.

385
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:16,880
Back in Colombia.

386
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,102
I took it really hard.

387
00:34:21,146 --> 00:34:23,148
I kind of put my dad through
a lot of shit after that,

388
00:34:23,191 --> 00:34:24,105
and...

389
00:34:26,977 --> 00:34:29,067
But we don't
have to get into it.

390
00:34:32,418 --> 00:34:33,332
- Okay.

391
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,781
I'm addicted...

392
00:34:47,824 --> 00:34:49,522
to m--

393
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:51,089
morphine.

394
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,094
- Well,
do you have some on you?

395
00:34:58,835 --> 00:34:59,749
- Uh--
- I'm kidding.

396
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:02,970
Oh, my God. Your face.

397
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:04,624
And now I feel bad.

398
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:07,888
- No. No, that's okay.
I...

399
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:09,672
I deserved that.

400
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:14,764
- So how long you been clean?

401
00:35:14,808 --> 00:35:16,505
- Almost nine months now.

402
00:35:18,072 --> 00:35:20,640
Well, not if you count...

403
00:35:20,683 --> 00:35:22,816
the heroin I did two days ago.

404
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,993
But I didn't really want it.

405
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:28,256
- Well, did someone hold you
down and force you to do it?

406
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:31,999
- Yeah.

407
00:35:33,392 --> 00:35:36,003
But I'm--I'm clean now.

408
00:35:38,962 --> 00:35:40,964
Are you crazy or something?

409
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,621
- I guess so.

410
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:52,976
I'm not like most people.

411
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,893
- I'm starting
to pick up on that.

412
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,859
- Olivia?

413
00:36:05,902 --> 00:36:08,166
Evan, from, uh, OkCupid.

414
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:12,822
- I'm sorry.
I have no idea who you are.

415
00:36:14,433 --> 00:36:16,304
- Isn't this you?

416
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:17,697
- Nope.

417
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,090
- This is totally you.

418
00:36:20,134 --> 00:36:22,092
- Look, it's getting late.

419
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:36,106
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Elliot.

420
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:46,073
- Well, you did better
than I thought you would.

421
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:48,249
- ♪ Yeah, I don't see
the light ♪

422
00:36:48,293 --> 00:36:51,600

00:39:06,866 --> 00:39:07,867
- Oh, shit.

435
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,216
Here, let me help.

436
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:14,395
I've got all this crap.

437
00:39:23,056 --> 00:39:24,100
It's not what you think.

438
00:39:37,418 --> 00:39:39,507
Look, earlier when I told you

439
00:39:39,551 --> 00:39:41,857
that I put my dad through
some shit when my mom died...

440
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:46,253
It was because of this.

441
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:56,481
I was really fucked up
after my mom got killed.

442
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:02,008
Murdered, actually.

443
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,498
I never say that to anyone.

444
00:40:20,766 --> 00:40:24,465
It totally wrecked me...

445
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:28,469
and I couldn't
pull myself out of it.

446
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:33,474
And then, one day,
someone gave me a pill, and...

447
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,826
That was that.
It was...

448
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,786
like, my way out
of that black hole.

449
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,881
But it led me right
into another one.

450
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:57,846
One that hurt a lot less.

451
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,764
For--for a while, anyway.

452
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,518
A reminder.

453
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:22,741
If I hate myself enough
to start using again,

454
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:24,525
I might as well kill myself.

455
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:41,890
So there it is.

456
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:44,893
The moment I tell you
I'm crazy too.

457
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:52,988
- I get it.

458
00:41:53,032 --> 00:41:55,034
I know what it's like.

459
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,691
- What?

460
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,260
- Hating yourself.

461
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:24,803
I almost did it once.

462
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,244
- What stopped you?

463
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:39,469
- I promised a kid I'd take him
to go see "The Martian."

464
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:45,911
Yeah, of course.

465
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:51,960
- You know,
you can't scare me.

466
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,792
- Well, there's a lot more
crazy where that came from.

467
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:06,279
But I think that's enough
for tonight.

468
00:43:22,817 --> 00:43:24,471
- Who knew Olivia
would be the one

469
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:27,517
to override Elliot's
attempts to deny access?

470
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:30,172
Now he's gotten the message:

471
00:43:30,216 --> 00:43:32,653
letting people in
doesn't have to hurt.

472
00:43:51,019 --> 00:43:52,978
Why are you stopped whenwe've got to get to Allsafe?

473
00:43:54,283 --> 00:43:57,286
- That van's been following us
since we got off the subway.

474
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:00,812
- Dark Army?

475
00:44:00,855 --> 00:44:01,769
- It's gotta be.

476
00:44:03,162 --> 00:44:05,947
- You think Oliviaratted us out?

477
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,906
- No.
We got out of there clean.

478
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:10,256
- This is a trap.

479
00:44:10,299 --> 00:44:11,736
We've been off the radarfor months.

480
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,390
All of a sudden, Whiterosetakes interest in us again?

481
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,610
What if she's tryingto find out about our plan?

482
00:44:19,439 --> 00:44:21,354
- Then let's show her
we don't have one.

483
00:44:23,269 --> 00:44:24,836
Just go home and act normal.

484
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,722
- Here's our turn again.

485
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:47,902
Loading a bullet
into a chamber...

486
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:50,470
spinning the cylinder...

487
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:52,777
and then...

488
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,653
the trigger.

489
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,830
Question is, are we getting
that friendly click?

490
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:06,747
Or is it the end of the game?

491
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,314
That's it.

492
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:10,577
We cannot go in there.

493
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,926
Let's make a run for it.

494
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:13,319
- Run where?

495
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:15,756
They're outside too.

496
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:20,892
- What do we do?

497
00:45:22,937 --> 00:45:25,418
- Exactly what we'd do
if we had nothing to hide.

498
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:33,295
- Like I said before,

499
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:36,472
letting people in
doesn't have to hurt...

500
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,736
but it can.

501
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,564
Especially if they're the type
of person that doesn't ask,

502
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:44,132
that just forces
their way in

503
00:45:44,176 --> 00:45:46,178
whether you want them to
or not.

504
00:45:49,442 --> 00:45:50,617
- Elliot.

505
00:45:52,184 --> 00:45:53,751
I've come with the news
we've been waiting for.

506
00:45:53,794 --> 00:45:56,841
They want to make me
CEO of E Corp.

507
00:45:56,884 --> 00:45:58,146
Are you hearing me?

508
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,800
The offer came directly
from Whiterose.

509
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:02,150
What's this--
what are you doing?

510
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,980
This is exactly
what we've been waiting for.

511
00:46:06,024 --> 00:46:08,809
We're on the inside.
It's time to take them down!

***End of Mr. Robot S04E03.srt
***Beginning of Mr. Robot S04E04.srt
1
00:00:02,263 --> 00:00:03,525
- Everything we did
was what they wanted.

2
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:05,614
I'm a prisoner,
just like before.

3
00:00:05,657 --> 00:00:06,832
- I'm going after Whiterose.

4
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:08,530
- I'm in.
Give me your phone.

5
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:11,663
I rigged Signal's API
so we could share locations.

6
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:12,795
- You fucked me!

7
00:00:12,838 --> 00:00:14,405
I lost everything
because of you.

8
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:17,365
My son's taken to Denmark,
and my wife's dead!

9
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,236
- The Dark Army
are just hackers.

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,672
- He turned the gun
on himself.

11
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,065
He erased his history.

12
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,632
- You work for
the Dark Army now.

13
00:00:23,675 --> 00:00:26,591
- My whole life is ruined
because of you.

14
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:28,680
- Olivia Cortez,
she's the Deus Group's

15
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,073
only U.S. account manager.

16
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:31,901
She's our way in.

17
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,077
- You wanted to work with me,
this is the way it is.

18
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:36,384
If there's a problem,
don't be here when I get back.

19
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:39,039
- I'm resigning
as CEO of E Corp.

20
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:42,346
- Call Mr. Wellick and offer
him the CEO position.

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,393
- That van's been following us
since we got off the subway.

22
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:50,050
- Elliot, we're on the inside.
It's time to take them down.

23
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:57,274
Elliot, I've come with the
news we've been waiting for.

24
00:00:57,318 --> 00:01:00,843
They want to make me CEO
of E Corp.

25
00:01:00,886 --> 00:01:02,236
Are you hearing me?

26
00:01:02,279 --> 00:01:04,281
The offer came directly
from Whiterose.

27
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:07,197
This is--what are you doing?

28
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:09,634
This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.

29
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:12,855
We're on the inside.
It's time to take them down.

30
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:19,209
I'm sorry, I've been under
a lot of stress.

31
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:22,082
I didn't mean to snap.

32
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,868
- No, uh, I get it.

33
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:29,045
Okay, uh, here,
have a seat.

34
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,830
You want--you want water
or something?

35
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,006
Let me get you a glass.

36
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:39,360
There you go.

37
00:01:39,403 --> 00:01:41,231
I'm gonna boot up my computer.

38
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,842
It'll just take a minute.

39
00:01:43,886 --> 00:01:45,192
Fuck.

40
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,019
I forgot the install
this morning.

41
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:49,457
Looks like it failed.
I wonder why.

42
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,159
Logs say "out of disk space."

43
00:01:56,203 --> 00:01:58,640
Just give me a second.

44
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,816
I need to adjust
the swap partitions.

45
00:02:04,036 --> 00:02:06,038
That should fix it.

46
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,650
"Boot device not found."

47
00:02:08,693 --> 00:02:12,175
Shit, now
my terminal's frozen.

48
00:02:12,219 --> 00:02:15,047
Hard drive might be shot.

49
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,050
You know what, I'm gonna--

50
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:49,560
- Oh, fuck.
- Get in, check the logs.

51
00:02:49,604 --> 00:02:51,867
If the recording wasn't
send back to Dark Army,

52
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:56,088
wipe everything and make sure
they can't track the van.

53
00:02:56,132 --> 00:02:58,178
- What about him?

54
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:02,573
- He's dead.

55
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,953
- To be clear,
I am not calling you

56
00:03:34,997 --> 00:03:37,826
because we are good.

57
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,263
I am calling
because I got into

58
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,613
Olivia's
Cyprus National Bank Account.

59
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:46,226
Unfortunately,
her access isn't good enough.

60
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,271
I can see all
the Deus account numbers,

61
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:51,100
but she's not authorized
to transfer anything.

62
00:03:51,143 --> 00:03:53,537
I got lateral access
inside the bank's system

63
00:03:53,581 --> 00:03:55,322
but hit a wall.

64
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:57,889
All their authentication
goes through a proxy,

65
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:00,805
and everything else on
their domain is read-only,

66
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,332
which means we are gonna have
to break into Virtual Realty

67
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,159
and get on their servers.

68
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,900
Since the Deus Group meeting
is tomorrow,

69
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,772
I'm scouting the place now.

70
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:12,817
Security is lax with Christmas,

71
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:16,952
so we need to do it ASAP.

72
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:22,174
Also, can't help but wonder
why exactly the fuck

73
00:04:22,218 --> 00:04:25,308
you are not answering my calls.

74
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,223
We were supposed to meet
at Allsafe,

75
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,486
or did you forget again?

76
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,837
Dick.

77
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,752
Okay, you know what?

78
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,363
I'm coming to your apartment,

79
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:37,668
and when I get there,

80
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:39,844
I expect you to have
heard this message

81
00:04:39,888 --> 00:04:42,499
and already be prepping
for Virtual Realty.

82
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:45,415
Oh, and when you do
get this voicemail,

83
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:48,723
keep this in mind: fuck you!

84
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:52,204
You are a fucking selfish
dickhead of an asshole

85
00:04:52,248 --> 00:04:56,296
who is the shittiest brother
on Earth!

86
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:59,211
I don't wanna say I hate you,
but I hate you.

87
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:02,040
I hate you so fucking much.

88
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:04,304
If I show up at your apartment
and you're hanging

89
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,350
from the goddamn ceiling
by a rope, that's cool.

90
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:10,048
In fact, that would be
my preference.

91
00:05:10,092 --> 00:05:13,051
So in sum, fuck off and die!

92
00:05:16,272 --> 00:05:17,926
- To continue your recording,
press two.

93
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:20,276
To delete your recording,
press three.

94
00:05:24,628 --> 00:05:27,544
Please re-record your message
at the tone.

95
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,114
- Hey, Elliot,

96
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:34,290
it's me.

97
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,125
- Elliot?

98
00:07:58,086 --> 00:08:00,915
- Okay, it looks like
the logs were never sent.

99
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,960
So all we gotta do
is get rid of the body

100
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:05,354
and the van,
and we're good to go, okay?

101
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,628
- I'm gonna go pick us up
a couple of snow shovels.

102
00:08:18,672 --> 00:08:20,543
- We're not here for shovels.

103
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,764
- What are we here for?

104
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,767
- Go inside, pay for the gas,
and grab a lighter.

105
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,078
- Oh, Internet's down.

106
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,515
No Ecoin.

107
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:42,347
$19.86.

108
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,655
Do I know you?

109
00:08:48,571 --> 00:08:50,878
- I don't think so.

110
00:08:53,097 --> 00:08:55,839
- You look awfully familiar.

111
00:08:55,883 --> 00:08:58,450
- Yeah, sorry,
we're kind of in a hurry.

112
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,759
- You sure we
haven't met before?

113
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:05,153
- Yeah, you must have me
mistaken for someone else.

114
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,415
- You an actor?

115
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,373
- Can you just ring him up?

116
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:11,899
- Wait, were you on
"Big Brother"?

117
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,336
- Yeah, that must be it.

118
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:17,121
- I knew it.
I never forget a face.

119
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:19,036
- Keep the change.

120
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,082
- Merry Christmas!

121
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,487
- Where'd you move the van to?

122
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,273
- I didn't move the van.

123
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:06,127
- Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

124
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,609
Hey, hey, thief!

125
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:12,089
Thief, I've called the police.
- Shit.

126
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:14,135
- Hey, dude, you're straight up
trying to steal my car.

127
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:15,397
- It's cool, man.
It's cool.

128
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,225
You don't need
to call the cops, okay?

129
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:18,835
I'm walking away.
- No--hold on.

130
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,012
You trying to steal my car
and walk away.

131
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,361
What's up?

132
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,580
- Dude, do you really
want to deal with the hassle

133
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,495
of calling the cops?

134
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,105
It's just gonna end in
an all-nighter for you

135
00:10:28,149 --> 00:10:30,934
at the station, followed by
a shit ton of paperwork.

136
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:33,850
Besides, nothing--
nothing happened.

137
00:10:33,894 --> 00:10:35,635
You busted me,
I'm walking away.

138
00:10:35,678 --> 00:10:37,506
No harm, no foul.

139
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:42,206
- Yeah, but I got questions
that need answering.

140
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,211
First, have you seen my keys?

141
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,909
- No.

142
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:53,391
- That was my only question.

143
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,089
- Can I please go now?

144
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:57,352
- Oh, wait,
I got another question.

145
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:59,876
Can you start my car?

146
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:03,619
- Really?

147
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,970
- Yeah, I usually use my keys,
and I can't seem to find them.

148
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:08,668
- Okay, you're
not really planning

149
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:10,278
on driving like this, are you?

150
00:11:10,321 --> 00:11:13,324
- Well, I gotta get home.

151
00:11:13,368 --> 00:11:15,065
- Dude, you are drunk as shit.

152
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:17,894
Can't you just call a cab
or something?

153
00:11:17,938 --> 00:11:20,854
- No, cabs don't go
where I'm headed.

154
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,856
- Where is that,
the North Pole?

155
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:24,684
- No.

156
00:11:24,727 --> 00:11:27,687
It's Upstate.
Foxrock.

157
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,129
- What's your name?

158
00:11:35,172 --> 00:11:36,870
- Tobias.

159
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,306
- Hi, Tobias.

160
00:11:38,349 --> 00:11:41,091
I'm Darlene.
We're friends, right?

161
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,095
- Yeah, I'd like that.

162
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,706
- Great.

163
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,316
So here's an idea.

164
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,753
I'll drive you home
if I can borrow

165
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,103
your car afterwards
for a quick errand.

166
00:11:55,627 --> 00:11:57,586
- You drive a hard bargain,
Dolly.

167
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:58,761
- Darlene.

168
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:01,633
- Exactly.
Let's ride!

169
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,683
- Oh, guys, I understand,

170
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,555
but like I said,
Internet's down.

171
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,122
Phone's hooked to the Internet,

172
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,908
so that means
phone is down too.

173
00:12:14,951 --> 00:12:16,866
We're kind of in the middle
of nowhere here.

174
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,694
- None of our phones
have service.

175
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,784
There's gotta be someplace
nearby with cell reception.

176
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,700
- Sure, back in town.
- What town?

177
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,746
- Pike's Hollow.

178
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,878
- How do we get there?

179
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,968
- It's too far to walk
unless you take the shortcut.

180
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:35,667
But my husband's coming
to pick me up in a bit,

181
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,147
if you want a ride.

182
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,670
- Where's the shortcut?

183
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:44,807
- Got it!

184
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,288
Tyrell Wellick, right?

185
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,725
That's how I know you.

186
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,945
But I never knew
you were on "Big Brother."

187
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:54,991
- Holy smokes!

188
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:59,256
I cannot believe
you are in my store.

189
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,605
Can I get a selfie?

190
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:03,043
- No, I'm not him.
You have me confused, okay?

191
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,827
- The shortcut,
how do we get there?

192
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,264
- Are you sure you're not
Tyrell Wellick?

193
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:08,700
E Corp fella.

194
00:13:08,744 --> 00:13:10,659
You are the spitting image
of him.

195
00:13:10,702 --> 00:13:13,662
- Yes, I'm sure.

196
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:16,578
- That's too bad.

197
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,537
Sure like to meet him one day.

198
00:13:19,581 --> 00:13:21,539
Seems like a nice guy.

199
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,846
- Jesus fucking Christ, woman!

200
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,067
Where is the shortcut?
How the fuck do we get to town?

201
00:13:29,765 --> 00:13:32,550
- Whoa, aren't you
friggin' rude?

202
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,644
Directly across the street,

203
00:13:39,688 --> 00:13:41,864
you'll see
an opening to a trail,

204
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:44,127
and that will take you through
the woods for a stretch,

205
00:13:44,171 --> 00:13:46,869
but be sure you veer left
at the creek.

206
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,828
You'll find yourself
in Pike's Hollow

207
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:53,658
in 30 minutes or so.

208
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:56,226
- Fucking finally.

209
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,882
- Wouldn't hurt you to learn
some manners on the walk.

210
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,753
- This is the right trail,
right?

211
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:14,408
The one across
from the gas station.

212
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:17,715
- There was only one.

213
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,370
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

214
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,163
So quiet out here.

215
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,822
Have you ever
considered leaving?

216
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,871
- What do you mean?

217
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:46,483
- Just walking off,
disappearing,

218
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,008
leaving the life
you're living behind you,

219
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,532
all the bullshit,
the stress, the pain,

220
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,447
everything?

221
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,579
You know, maybe start over

222
00:16:55,623 --> 00:16:58,060
where no one knows you
and reinvent yourself

223
00:16:58,104 --> 00:17:02,195
and forget about all the
mistakes you made in this life.

224
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,849
Find some peace.

225
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:07,896
Some rest.

226
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:10,551
I think about that.

227
00:17:10,594 --> 00:17:12,944
Don't you?

228
00:17:13,771 --> 00:17:15,904
- No.

229
00:17:20,778 --> 00:17:22,693
- Any sign of the creek?

230
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:26,567
- Well, maybe it's still
up ahead.

231
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,091
- Ah.

232
00:17:29,135 --> 00:17:30,962
We've been walking
for a while.

233
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:32,747
We shoulda come
across it by now.

234
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,271
- How do you know if we should
have come across it by now?

235
00:17:35,315 --> 00:17:37,273
- Because we've been walking
for fucking hours.

236
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:39,101
That's how.
- Don't get mad at me.

237
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:41,016
I don't know where
the goddamn creek is.

238
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,626
- You were the one
who took off this way.

239
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,976
- Unbelievable--you're
blaming me that we're lost?

240
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,892
- I blame you
that we're even here.

241
00:17:47,936 --> 00:17:49,938
You said he was dead.
- He was.

242
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:51,679
- Well, then how did
he drive the van?

243
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:53,072
- I don't fucking know!

244
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:54,856
- All right, all right.

245
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,901
Let's all calm down.

246
00:17:56,945 --> 00:17:58,381
Take it easy.

247
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:11,133
- What was that?
A dog?

248
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,269
- Who knows?

249
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:17,705
We're in the middle
of the woods.

250
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:18,836
Could be anything.

251
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,621
- Maybe a coyote.

252
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:21,665
Or a wolf.

253
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,887
That.

254
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:31,197
You hear it?

255
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,200
- Let's just keep going.
Maybe the creek is up ahead.

256
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:48,866
- She knew my face.

257
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,738
- What?

258
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,827
- The cashier.

259
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,003
She knew my face.

260
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:58,049
- So what?

261
00:18:58,093 --> 00:19:00,356
- That means she can ID me.

262
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:08,756
- You search, you find,
all is well.

263
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,585
But what if you search
and you don't find?

264
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:13,413
How long do you look?

265
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,722
Eventually, you've
gotta give up, right?

266
00:19:18,766 --> 00:19:21,290
Then what?

267
00:19:21,334 --> 00:19:24,250
That thing you were searching
for, what becomes of it?

268
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:27,078
How could you ever know?

269
00:19:27,122 --> 00:19:30,908
- ♪ Joey

270
00:19:30,952 --> 00:19:33,737
♪ Baby

271
00:19:35,391 --> 00:19:39,526
- ♪ Don't get crazy

272
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,136
- Big night tonight?

273
00:19:43,617 --> 00:19:45,793
- Uh, no.

274
00:19:45,836 --> 00:19:48,839
I'm not the real Santa.

275
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:51,102
- Yeah.

276
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:53,714
- Sometimes I wish I were.

277
00:19:56,847 --> 00:19:58,936
Sometimes I wish I were...

278
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,592
- ♪ I know you've
heard it all before ♪

279
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,942
♪ So I don't say it anymore

280
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,683
- Where'd you go there, Tobias?

281
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:10,339
- Oh, just thinking.

282
00:20:10,383 --> 00:20:12,776
Jimmy.

283
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,996
Good guy.

284
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,129
Fell on some tough times.

285
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:21,524
You know how sometimes
the world just seems like

286
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:26,268
it's kicking you down
and you can't get up?

287
00:20:26,312 --> 00:20:28,227
- Christ, do I ever.

288
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,968
- That's Jimmy.

289
00:20:31,012 --> 00:20:32,753
And you know how it is.

290
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:36,104
Soon you're out
in the cold winter night,

291
00:20:36,147 --> 00:20:39,238
asking a lot of questions,

292
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,370
looking at the world,

293
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:46,245
thinking about what it might be
like without you in it.

294
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:13,489
- Do you have to do that?

295
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,709
- It's a Christmas song.
- It's annoying.

296
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:27,068
I just got it.

297
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:29,462
Why you wear that hoodie.

298
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,203
I've never seen you
in anything else.

299
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:35,598
Black hoodie,
black jeans, black shoes,

300
00:21:35,642 --> 00:21:37,339
always the same.

301
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,254
I've been wondering
this whole time,

302
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,996
but now I finally get it.

303
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,520
You don't care.

304
00:21:45,739 --> 00:21:47,828
- Sure, why not?

305
00:21:47,871 --> 00:21:50,178
- Silk tie,

306
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,572
$6,000 suit.

307
00:21:55,444 --> 00:22:00,231
I mean, it sounds pathetic
to say aloud, but...

308
00:22:00,275 --> 00:22:04,018
I actually care.

309
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:07,064
And you know what?

310
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,545
That's why I'm a failure.

311
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:13,375
My entire life,
I've been an outsider,

312
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:16,247
worried what other people
think of me,

313
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:19,381
how I can make them happy,

314
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:22,776
because I needed their approval
and their acceptance.

315
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:28,695
But you never cared.

316
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:31,262
The first day we met,

317
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:34,396
there we were, Allsafe's
most important clients

318
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,444
roaming through the office,
and you couldn't care less.

319
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:49,498
We're gonna die out here.

320
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:52,458
Maybe not tonight, but soon.

321
00:22:52,501 --> 00:22:55,112
The Dark Army soldier,

322
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:58,507
he's likely
reported back by now.

323
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:01,380
It's only a matter of time
before they find us.

324
00:23:12,303 --> 00:23:14,480
- Did you hear that?

325
00:23:14,523 --> 00:23:17,831
- If there's traffic,
we gotta be close to town.

326
00:23:37,372 --> 00:23:38,895
- Hey!
- Hey!

327
00:23:38,939 --> 00:23:41,115
- Hey!
- Hey!

328
00:23:41,158 --> 00:23:43,422
- Hey!
- Hey!

329
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,428
- Jesus Christ!

330
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:04,486
- So what's with the getup?

331
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,359
Mall Santa?
Salvation Army?

332
00:24:08,403 --> 00:24:11,014
- Sloan Kettering.

333
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:13,539
It's a cancer center.

334
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,498
I do it for the kids.

335
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,849
Dude, that's dope.

336
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:25,246
You're definitely
a better person than me.

337
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:27,509
So what,
the kids served spiked nog?

338
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:31,818
- No, me and some
of the other volunteers,

339
00:24:31,861 --> 00:24:36,910
we got a little tradition
after visiting the hospital.

340
00:24:36,953 --> 00:24:38,477
- What's that?

341
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,262
- We get drunk.

342
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:45,092
- Nice tradition, I guess.

343
00:24:45,135 --> 00:24:48,617
- Yeah, you know the kids,

344
00:24:48,661 --> 00:24:51,881
they love when we drop by.

345
00:24:51,925 --> 00:24:56,712
So many smiling faces.

346
00:24:56,756 --> 00:25:01,500
This might be the last time
I do it though.

347
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,764
You know, the thing
that really gets you?

348
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,812
Some of 'em are so small.

349
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:18,952
It's almost as if
they were just born to die.

350
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:24,261
- Jesus.

351
00:25:24,305 --> 00:25:27,221
No wonder you're plastered.

352
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:30,746
How else do you
get through that?

353
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:35,185
- Well, it was easier
when my wife went with me,

354
00:25:35,229 --> 00:25:37,579
but...

355
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:40,495
since the accident...

356
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,769
- What do you got there,
Tobias?

357
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:58,252
- Oh, I like to keep
a nip or two on me

358
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,602
during the holidays.

359
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:03,126
- I'm not talking
about the booze.

360
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,999
- Oh, Percocet.

361
00:26:11,091 --> 00:26:15,399
Sometimes the--
the pain's just too much.

362
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:23,059
- Alexa, play
"slow jams" playlist.

363
00:26:23,103 --> 00:26:24,800
- Playing "slow jams"
playlist.

364
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,804
- So this is my apartment.

365
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,028
- You know,
when we were chatting,

366
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:38,814
I just imagined
this super organized.

367
00:26:40,686 --> 00:26:42,296
- Well, I--I actually
did clean up earlier.

368
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:45,342
- No, I like it.

369
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:48,650
- ♪ Maybe even you

370
00:26:48,694 --> 00:26:55,091
- You want a drink?

371
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:58,442
I have one Tecate.

372
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:00,531
We can share.

373
00:27:00,575 --> 00:27:03,099
- ♪ Recline complete

374
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:05,362
♪ Dream too sweet

375
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:08,539
♪ I can't do it not with you

376
00:27:08,583 --> 00:27:11,151
♪ Not even with you

377
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:14,458
♪ Maybe never with you

378
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,680
- So my apartment
being organized

379
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:21,378
was part of your fantasy
in our chat?

380
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:25,861
- Well, you know,
just visualizing.

381
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,693
- I guess that's
the thing about IRC.

382
00:27:31,737 --> 00:27:34,435
Everyone gets to imagine
exactly what they want.

383
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:38,352
- ♪ Total control

384
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:41,660
- Is that why you do it?

385
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,271
- I like how I can
control everything.

386
00:27:46,447 --> 00:27:49,711
- ♪ Over you

387
00:27:49,755 --> 00:27:53,149
- ♪ Total control over you

388
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:55,674
- I have this fantasy that
I'm the only person from IRC

389
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:58,111
you've ever invited over.

390
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:01,462
- ♪ Over you

391
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:03,377
♪ Total control over you

392
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,379
- You are.

let me just--

396
00:28:40,631 --> 00:28:42,372
I'll be right back.

397
00:28:42,416 --> 00:28:45,288
- Okay.

398
00:28:45,332 --> 00:28:47,377
- ♪ Maybe even you

399
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:50,337
♪ Stay in bed

400
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,861
♪ Stained sheets

401
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:56,125
♪ My head hurts

402
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:59,346
♪ I repeat

403
00:29:18,452 --> 00:29:21,063
- Stop fighting so hard.

404
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,331
You're gonna lose control
faster that way.

405
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:33,641
- Give into it.

406
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:36,122
Give up control.

407
00:29:39,473 --> 00:29:43,346
Realize you'll never be free.

408
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,414
- Um...

409
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:54,504
Tobias?

410
00:30:54,548 --> 00:30:56,680
- What's up?

411
00:30:59,466 --> 00:31:01,729
Hold on now.

412
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:05,080
Whose car is that?

413
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:07,300
- That was gonna be
my question.

414
00:31:07,343 --> 00:31:08,692
- Hey.

415
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:11,782
That's my car.

416
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:17,614
Oh, I get it now.

417
00:31:17,658 --> 00:31:21,444
Uh, you see,
I didn't drive today.

418
00:31:21,488 --> 00:31:23,969
Kenny drove.

419
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:26,885
He picked me up at--
- Okay, Tobias.

420
00:31:26,928 --> 00:31:30,976
If that is your car,
whose car is this?

421
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,718
- I have no clue.

422
00:31:37,808 --> 00:31:39,898
Christmas, huh?

423
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:45,294
- Good-bye, Tobias.

424
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:50,865
- Good-bye
is short and final.

425
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,665
- Hey.
Hey.

426
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:10,624
Hey.

427
00:32:10,667 --> 00:32:12,104
Look,

428
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:14,889
I know it might not
be my place, but...

429
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,936
I wanna help you.

430
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:20,634
- You wanna help me?

431
00:32:20,677 --> 00:32:22,853
- I don't want you
to hurt yourself.

432
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:28,947
- Holy crow, what the heck
are you talking about?

433
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,992
- What do you mean,
you're all sad and lonely

434
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:33,734
going on about Jimmy,
your suicidal "friend."

435
00:32:33,777 --> 00:32:35,649
- Jimmy Stewart.

436
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,390
"It's a Wonderful Life."

437
00:32:37,433 --> 00:32:39,087
Christmas classic.

438
00:32:39,131 --> 00:32:41,916
- Tobias, you just told me
good-bye is final.

439
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,700
- That is Steinbeck.

440
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:46,573
He's a national treasure.
Read a book.

441
00:32:46,616 --> 00:32:49,010
- Okay, what about the pills?

442
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:51,360
Okay, you're drunk as shit and
you have a bottle of Percocet.

443
00:32:51,404 --> 00:32:54,189
Explain that.

444
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,712
- For my wife.

445
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:57,149
- Your wife's dead.

446
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:02,023
- My wife is dead?

447
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,765
- Wait--you said
she had an accident.

448
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:08,725
- She threw her back out

449
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:14,383
when we were putting the Santa
on the roof yesterday.

450
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,429
She's in brutal pain.

451
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:18,474
She can barely move.

452
00:33:18,518 --> 00:33:19,736
Doc wrote a prescription--

453
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,522
- Okay, you fucking scared me.

454
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,570
- Hey, Dolly.
- Darlene.

455
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:30,704
- Are you okay?

456
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:33,011
- Yeah, I'm okay.
Why wouldn't I be?

457
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:38,059
- You wanna talk about it?

458
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:40,366
- There's nothing
to talk about.

459
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:43,891
- You sure?

460
00:33:45,458 --> 00:33:46,981
- Yes.

461
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,941
- All right.

462
00:33:50,985 --> 00:33:53,248
Have a great night.

463
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:58,949
- Fine.

464
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:06,566
I have lost
absolutely everyone,

465
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:10,265
my boyfriend,
my best friend, my parents.

466
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:12,441
The only one I have left
is my brother,

467
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:17,446
who is an asshole that
treats me like absolute shit.

468
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:19,970
But I'm really worried
about him right now,

469
00:34:20,014 --> 00:34:21,885
and it pisses me off
that I'm worried,

470
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,279
because I am always
worried about him,

471
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:27,456
and he flat-out told me
to fuck off.

472
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,371
So why do I bother?

473
00:34:31,678 --> 00:34:34,333
I don't know.

474
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:37,814
I don't know, I'm afraid
this time it's different.

475
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:40,339
I'm afraid he might be dead.

476
00:34:48,564 --> 00:34:50,523
- Okay.

477
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:08,280
- Reception?
- No.

478
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,153
Time.

479
00:35:14,503 --> 00:35:17,115
Just realizing
it's Christmas.

480
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:22,555
- Can't be much further.
- To what?

481
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,731
- Town.

482
00:35:24,774 --> 00:35:26,167
- Let's stop
lying to ourselves.

483
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:28,387
We're nowhere near town.
We're completely lost.

484
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,780
- We just gotta keep moving.
- Why?

485
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:33,435
Even if we magically made it
to this Pike's Hollow place,

486
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,655
the town is gonna be swarming
with Dark Army.

487
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:39,137
- We've gotta try.
- You aren't listening to me.

488
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,401
Whatever we're walking towards,
it ends with death.

489
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:56,197
- What are you doing?

490
00:35:58,243 --> 00:36:00,680
- There's a rock in my shoe.

491
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:23,006
You honestly don't care
about me, do you?

492
00:36:24,312 --> 00:36:26,271
- What are you
talking about now?

493
00:36:26,314 --> 00:36:29,230
- Like why you wear that
same hoodie every day.

494
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:32,102
You don't care.

495
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,409
Did you ever care about me?

496
00:36:34,453 --> 00:36:36,194
I mean, be honest,
I can take it.

497
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:37,934
- What is the point of this?

498
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:39,980
- Just answer the question,
did you?

499
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,374
- Tyrell, you didn't
make it easy--

500
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:45,768
- Just answer the question!
- No!

501
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,516
- The sound of death.

502
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,997
- It's just some stupid animal.
Let's go.

503
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:00,261
- Go without me.
- What?

504
00:37:00,305 --> 00:37:03,090
You're giving up?
- Yeah.

505
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:05,005
I think so.

506
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,443
- I can't deal
with this shit anymore.

507
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:27,549
Come on.

508
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:29,595
You stay out here alone,

509
00:37:29,638 --> 00:37:32,989
you can be sure
it's game over.

510
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:35,296
You're better than this.

511
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,647
- Yeah, maybe I was,
but not anymore.

512
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,867
- I'm going.

513
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:42,869
- Yeah, go, Elliot.

514
00:37:42,912 --> 00:37:45,480
- I will.
- Yeah, good.

515
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:47,308
'Cause you don't need me.
You never needed me.

516
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:48,744
That's the truth, right?

517
00:37:48,788 --> 00:37:52,052
- Yeah, that's the truth,
I never fucking needed you!

518
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:54,054
You were only in the way!

519
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,316
If it weren't for you--

520
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,101
- The world
would've been saved?

521
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,713
And you would have been
the savior?

522
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,236
Is that what you think?

523
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,630
Is that the fantasy
I ruined for you?

524
00:38:04,673 --> 00:38:06,980
- Stay here, die!

525
00:38:07,023 --> 00:38:10,462
I don't give a fuck about you!

526
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:12,725
I'm done!

527
00:38:14,509 --> 00:38:16,816
- Good!

528
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:18,296
Look around you!

529
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:23,213
All signs lead to the same
hopeless destination,

530
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:25,999
and the sooner you realize
that, the better,

531
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,088
for you're so much
in your own head

532
00:38:28,131 --> 00:38:30,046
that you can't see the truth!

533
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:32,222
That it's over!

534
00:38:34,573 --> 00:38:36,531
- Seems like we're always
thinking of ourselves

535
00:38:36,575 --> 00:38:40,318
when looking for something
that's lost,

536
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:43,886
but we never think much
about the lost,

537

00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,113

would pick on the little bitch

32

every day after school.

33
00:01:11,506 --> 00:01:14,204

little bitch got robbed.

34
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:16,902

35
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,991

38

to change it all.

on this Xmas morning

47
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:03,340
when he got out
of his little bedroom

48
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:07,127
and looked
under his little tree,

49
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,390
guess what he found.

50
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:17,528
- An Easton Magnum
aluminum baseball bat.

51
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:21,924
Little bitch grabbed that bat

52
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,579
and went right outside to play.

53
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:27,930
Didn't even take the bow off,
he was so excited.

54
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:30,933
And there he was
on the corner ball field,

55
00:02:30,976 --> 00:02:33,544

like he was Sammy Sosa

56
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:36,417

57
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,463

eyeing that bat.

59
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:48,907
And just as the bully
made his way up to him,

60
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:52,259
without any warning...

61
00:02:52,302 --> 00:02:54,609

66
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:08,971
blood dripping down the bow
still wrapped around that bat.

67
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,888

knocked every tooth out

68
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,151

69
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,240
Cracked his skull open,

70
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:20,591
popped his eyeball out
on home plate.

71
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,948
- All because little bitch
saw the truth.

72
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:35,345
That bat may have been made
to play ball,

73
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:39,480
but that wasn't its purpose.

74
00:03:39,523 --> 00:03:42,091

75
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,963
In that moment
in little bitch's hands,

76
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:48,010
it was there to break
this nigga's head open.

78

80

81
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,299

103
00:05:42,385 --> 00:05:45,214
- The other day, when...

104
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:50,132
I said that I should never
have let you back in my life...

105
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:53,440
I was an asshole.

106
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:56,530
I'm sorry.

107
00:05:56,573 --> 00:06:00,447
- You still have my Signal mod
running on your phone, right?

108
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,145
- Yeah, why?

109
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:06,148
- Just be careful, okay?

110
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:10,152
Keep your phone on you
so I can see where you are.

111
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,328
I don't want to lose you again.

112
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,291
- Oh, thank you.

113
00:06:19,335 --> 00:06:21,119
- I--I got to go.

114
00:06:36,221 --> 00:06:38,485
- Elli.

115
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:42,053
Ah, long time no see, cuz.

116
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:43,664
Where do I knowthis place from?

117
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,492
- Do you have it?

118
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:47,494
Of course I got it, bro.

119
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:54,152
Under the table.

120
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,424
Where you going?

121
00:07:04,467 --> 00:07:06,338
- I got to go.

122
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,514
- Damn, you just gon' leavelike that?

123
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:09,472
Thought we gonna catch up.

124
00:07:09,516 --> 00:07:11,866
- Sorry, man,
I--I got shit to do.

125
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:17,088
Listen, just so you know,
I'm full-time freelance now.

126
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,526
Only loyalty
is to the almighty paper.

127
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,875
So hang on to my number.

128
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,529
Should you need anything,

129
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:25,183
you know I'm your guy.

130
00:07:25,227 --> 00:07:26,620
You be strange, now,

131
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,839
but don't be a stranger,know what I mean?

132
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,629
Peace, Elli.

133
00:07:50,644 --> 00:07:52,384
- We don't have to do this.

134
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,821
We can find a way
to talk to her.

135
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,518
- And if she says no?

136
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,346
Then we reason with her.

137
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:00,131
- And if she still says no?

138
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,177
We don't have timefor taking risks.

139
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,875
This is the only way.

140
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:09,532
- Hey. What you're about to do
is crossing a line.

141
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:12,448
- Well, it's a little latefor that, don't you think?

142
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,452
- He's right.

143
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,758
We used to have a code.

144
00:08:17,801 --> 00:08:21,326
Lines we would not cross,
parameters we set.

145
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:24,286
Those seem to have been
seriously modified.

146
00:08:24,329 --> 00:08:27,811
Question is, can we bring
those boundaries back?

147
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:30,727
Or is it like he said,
too late?

148
00:08:32,686 --> 00:08:35,515
- Two large peppermint mochas.

149
00:08:35,558 --> 00:08:38,343
- What were you doing
in Pike's Hollow this morning?

150
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:42,652
- How did you get in here?

151
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,872
- Where's your brother?

152
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,528
Did you take him somewhere?

153
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,488
Is he still in the city?

154
00:08:59,626 --> 00:09:01,584
Okay.

155
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,638
Fuck, Darlene,
you should have kept driving.

156
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:13,335
- Who are you calling?

157
00:09:13,378 --> 00:09:15,555
You can't call this into the FBI.

158
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:17,513
If the Dark Army finds outabout that crime scene,

159
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,514
they're gonna send someone--

160
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,864
- They already did.

161
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,522
Have a seat.

162
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,568
- A guy who continually talks

163
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:31,266
to an invisible entity
that isn't there...

164
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,789
Has arguments with him.

165
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,878
The invisible entity
interrupts him sometimes.

166
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,536
Clorox.
- Market.

167
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,495
- How may I help you?
- I have her.

168
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:46,673
- Oh, well done.

169
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,762
And her brother?

170
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:51,852
- No, and she's not
giving him up.

171
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:54,289
- Uh-huh.

172
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:57,553
Well, that's not great.

173
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,425
Keep her close.
Let me run it up the flagpole.

174
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:02,253
Call you back in a bit.

175
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:05,343
- Return
of a biblical prophet,

176
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,780
Jan Matthys is preaching

177
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:08,651
death and repentance
before the Second Coming,

178
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:10,044
and those who are not part
of the chosen people...

179
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:11,393
- Hello, sweetheart.

180
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,916
- Are going to be
horribly killed.

181
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,968
- I brought peppermint mochas.

182
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,411
- They said it was Christmas
in a cup.

183
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:31,718
- Well, it is indeed Christmas.

184
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,636
Very sweet.

185
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:47,603
Do you want to come in?

186
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,084
- Yeah.

187
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,868
- Okay.

188
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,325
- What I'm about to tell you
is gonna sound...

189
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,939
A little crazy.

190
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,466
- What's up?

191
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,602
- It's about your clients.

192
00:11:30,646 --> 00:11:32,996
My clients?

193
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:36,957
- At Cyprus National Bank.

194
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:51,972
- I never told you
where I work.

195
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:54,104
- A bank
that primarily does business

196
00:11:54,148 --> 00:11:56,977
with the Deus Group.

197
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,979
Whoa.

198
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:00,720
What the fuck is this?

199
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,634
- They're a criminal enterprise

200
00:12:02,678 --> 00:12:05,507
that uses their power
and wealth to run the world

201
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,945
without anyone knowing it.

202
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,686
- Okay, I don't know
why you're--

203
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,820
- Tiananmen Square,
civil war in the Congo,

204
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,692
both Iraq wars,

205
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,521
the paramilitary massacre
in El Salado...

206
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,527
The cyber bombings.

207
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,572
That's not even their top five.

208
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:32,403
- Okay...

209
00:12:32,447 --> 00:12:35,798
You're really starting
to scare me.

210
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,975
Tell me what you're doing.
Why do you know where I work?

211
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:42,674
- I hacked you.

212
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:44,589
- Excuse me?

213
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:48,028
- I hacked you.

214
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:53,120
- Why?

215
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,731
- I need you to do something
for me.

216
00:12:57,167 --> 00:12:59,169
- What--what is this?

217
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,738
- I need you to make
one phone call to your boss.

218
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,871
I'm already on
their proxy server.

219
00:13:04,914 --> 00:13:07,874
I just need him to log in
so I can swipe his credentials.

220
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:12,487
- I know this doesn't
make sense to you right now,

221
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,012
but trust me, Olivia...

222
00:13:16,056 --> 00:13:18,667
they're using you.

223
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,713
They're using me?

224
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:25,587
- They are,
but I can stop them.

225
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:28,068
I can stop them
once and for all.

226
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:30,853
All I need is one phone call
from you.

227
00:13:36,641 --> 00:13:37,817
- Get out.

228
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:43,083
- Don't do this.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

229
00:13:43,126 --> 00:13:45,912
This conversation's over.

230
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:48,828
Get the fuck out.

231
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:50,525
Now.

232
00:14:21,948 --> 00:14:24,689
- What happens
if you fail a drug test?

233
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,826
- What did you say?

234
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,220
- I know about
your custody battle.

235
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:39,835
If you test positive for Oxy--

236
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,184
- What the fuck
are you talking about?

237
00:14:41,228 --> 00:14:43,230
I'm eight years clean.

238
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:48,017
- No, you're not.

239
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,957
- You drugged me?

240
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:22,269
- I had to make sure
you would listen.

241
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:24,358
You're gonna call your boss
in Cyprus.

242
00:15:24,401 --> 00:15:26,838
You're gonna get him to log in
to the bank website,

243
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:28,623
and that's it.

244
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,103
Then I'm gone.

245
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:43,203
If you don't do what I say...

246
00:15:43,246 --> 00:15:45,988
you lose your son.

247
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,218
Why are you doing this?

248
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,269
- I was running out of time.

249
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:11,144
This was the fastest way
to convince you.

250
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:21,197
- This was taken one mile

251
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,286
from where the van
following Mr. Alderson

252
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,158
was found burned.

253
00:16:25,201 --> 00:16:27,638
We have his sister,

254
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:30,250
but we're still searching
for him.

255
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,949
The minute we find him,

256
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,907
I think...

257
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,173
- You think what?

258
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:45,787
- It's time, Minister Zhang.

259
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,397
He's too much of a liability.

260
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,443
- Oh, you're being foolish.

261
00:16:49,486 --> 00:16:50,748
If we kill him,

262
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:52,402
his shipping hack
dies with him.

263
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,275
- We have the Deus Group
meeting tonight.

264
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,103
- Think about
what you're saying.

265
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:59,148
- The entire membership
will be there.

266
00:16:59,192 --> 00:17:00,323
It's too risky.

267
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:01,933
- I will not get this close

268
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:05,763
only to watch it
slip away again.

269
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:08,157
I want you
to locate Mr. Alderson

270
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:10,203
and bring him in.

271
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,335
He should see
the full potential

272
00:17:12,379 --> 00:17:15,164
of what we're working towards.

273
00:17:18,994 --> 00:17:22,345
It's time he learns
we're on the same side.

274
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:42,887
- Placemat.
- Bandit.

275
00:17:42,931 --> 00:17:45,194
How's everything over there?

276
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:47,979
- Fine.
- Good news and bad news.

277
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,460
The higher-ups want Elliot,
not his sister.

278
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,463
I don't suppose she's
mentioned where he is yet?

279
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:55,900
- She wouldn't do that.

280
00:17:55,944 --> 00:17:57,946
I heard her talking to him
earlier, though.

281
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,339
We can get his location
off her phone.

282
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:01,036
- Oh, interesting.

283
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,343
And you have her phone,
I assume.

284
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:06,389
- Yeah, I got it right here,
so we don't need her.

285
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:08,130
- Fantastic.

286
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:11,090
Well, then, I'll be there with
my team to collect the phone.

287
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:14,136
- And her?

288
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,486
- Kill her.

289
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,410
- What?

290
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:29,151
- You said it yourself.
We don't need her.

291
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:31,066
Cleaner this way.

292
00:18:35,026 --> 00:18:38,160
You can handle that, right?

293
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,335
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:18:39,379 --> 00:18:41,120
- Because I recall
the last time

295
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,425
you didn't feel 100--

296
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,558
- No.

297
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,037
I'm fine.

298
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:48,518
- I'm just saying,
if you don't feel 100%

299
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:51,173
like last time, you should
let me know right now

300
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:52,566
so I can set aside the time

301
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:53,958
to kill your mother
and your entire family.

302
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:56,918
- No.

303
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:58,311
I can handle it.

304
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:02,402
- Great. I'll be there
at 3:30 on the dot.

305
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:04,317
Make sure it's done by then.

306
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,929
- What?

307
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:19,288
What did they say?

308
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,558
Fuck!
What the fuck?

309
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,952
Wait!

310
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:33,563
Wait! Fucking wait!

311
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,565
- Get up!

312
00:19:38,394 --> 00:19:41,223
What the fuck are you doing?

313
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,964
- Keeping my family safe.

314
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,313
On your knees!

315
00:19:50,537 --> 00:19:54,018
So this is it, then?

316
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:56,412
They tell you to kill me,
and you're just gonna do it?

317
00:19:56,456 --> 00:19:57,979
- Your phone
gives them Elliot's location,

318
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,023
so they don't need you.

319
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:00,938
- This is crazy.This isn't you, Dom!

320
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,331
You don't need tofucking do this!

321
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,246
- I can't believe
you have the balls to say that.

322
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,639
You ruined my life.

323
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:07,118
- I did.I'll own that, okay?

324
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,468
But that doesn't make you this!

325
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:10,600
You don't just fuckingshoot people in cold blood!

326
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:13,299
- I'm here because of you.
- I know.

327
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:16,519
- You did this to me!
- I know!

328
00:20:16,563 --> 00:20:18,347
Okay, you were right.

329
00:20:18,391 --> 00:20:20,306
Okay? I was wrong.

330
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,177
Give me a chanceto make it right.

331
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,223
I can get you out of this.

332
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:26,181
- There's no way out.
- I have a plan.

333
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,183
- You think I give a shit
about your plan?

334
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,098
- We are gonna take downthe Dark Army once and for all.

335
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,143
It's happening tonight.

336
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:34,450
- It's too late.

337
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:37,105
Please, Dom, it's not too late.

338
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,541
- No, it has to be like this.

339
00:20:38,585 --> 00:20:41,065
There's not enough time.
It's too late.

340
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:43,154
- Dom, listen to me!

341
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:45,418
Listen to me.I know I fucked up, okay?

342
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,463
But it's not too late.

343
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:49,683
If you let me go,I can stop this, okay?

344
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:52,076
I swear to God,if you just let me go.

345
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,991
Please!
- I'm sorry.

346
00:20:56,037 --> 00:20:58,126
No, no, no, please!

347
00:20:58,169 --> 00:20:59,475
Don't be sorry, Dom.

348
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,129
Don't be, don't be!

349
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,132
Don't be sorry, Dom, okay?Please, Dom, don't be sorry.

350
00:21:04,175 --> 00:21:06,569
You don't need to do this.You are a good person!

351
00:21:06,613 --> 00:21:09,268
This isn't you!
- Shut up!

352
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,189
Shit, shit, shit.

353
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,410
Shit.

354
00:21:21,454 --> 00:21:24,152
- How soon
can he get back to me?

355
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:27,677
It's urgent, yes.

356
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:31,115
I know, but it's regarding
Mr. Kuklachev.

357
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:33,596
He'll want to know.

358
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,296
Okay, great.

359
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:41,256
Merry Christmas.

360
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:49,090
- How longdo you think it'll be?

361
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:51,397
- Fuck you.

362
00:21:56,489 --> 00:22:00,101
My life is over.
I want you to know that.

363
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:01,494
- You just have to talk to him.

364
00:22:01,537 --> 00:22:04,018
Then I'll go.

365
00:22:04,061 --> 00:22:06,629
Nothing will be traced to you.

366
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,459
- And you think that's it, huh?

367
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,333
You just drugged an addict.

368
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:18,467
- You'll get through it.

369
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:21,165
- You arrogant piece of shit.

370
00:22:22,602 --> 00:22:23,864
Maybe you can have a slip

371
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:27,346
and it's not the end
of the world, but I can't.

372
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:30,349
It destroys me.

373
00:22:30,392 --> 00:22:32,351
So fuck you.

374
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,703
- Maybe you should havethought about that

375
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:39,619
before you worked for them.

376
00:22:39,662 --> 00:22:42,578
- What's that supposed to mean?

377
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:48,149
- Offshore bank in Cyprus.

378
00:22:48,192 --> 00:22:50,673
Kind of moneythat goes through there.

379
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:53,633
You know, come on.

380
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:56,462
You're not dumb.

381
00:22:56,505 --> 00:22:58,768
I'm sure a part of youhas always known.

382
00:22:58,812 --> 00:23:01,292
You choseto look the other way.

383
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:04,208
- My choices
are none of your business.

384
00:23:04,252 --> 00:23:06,341
- I get it.

385
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,561
You needed a job.
They were paying well.

386
00:23:08,604 --> 00:23:11,390
That's how they do it.
That's their business model.

387
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:14,349
They back everyone
into a corner

388
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:18,048
until all that's left is for us
to compromise ourselves.

389
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,488
That's why what I'm doing
has to be done.

390
00:23:22,531 --> 00:23:25,578
They're hurting you...

391
00:23:25,621 --> 00:23:27,580
just like they're hurting
all of us.

392
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:31,235
-  The only one
hurting me right now is you.

393
00:23:35,892 --> 00:23:38,242
I wonder how many people
you've had to hurt

394
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,810
to get what you want.

395
00:23:40,854 --> 00:23:42,595
Hmm?

396
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:47,208
How many has it been, Elliot?

397
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,343
How many people
have had to suffer

398
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:54,433
because of you?

399
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,094
Was it worth it?

400
00:24:20,284 --> 00:24:22,809
I'm a mess.

401
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:26,856
Can I use the bathroom?

402
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,599
- Yeah, go ahead.

403
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,268
So was fucking me
part of the plan,

404
00:24:47,311 --> 00:24:49,575
or was that just
a happy accident?

405
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,796
- It was an accident.

406
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,543
- That's sweet.

407
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:22,738
- It's almost done.

408
00:25:22,782 --> 00:25:26,960
Once her boss calls back,we'll get what we need and go.

409
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,054
This would have allbeen simpler

410
00:25:34,097 --> 00:25:37,797
if she wasn't so deep in denialabout who she's working for.

411
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,801
- There it is.

412
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:44,412
That sense of dread.

413
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,676
It only happens
when you cross a line

414
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,506
you didn't even know existed.

415
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,987
Maybe that dread
is a good thing.

416
00:25:59,993 --> 00:26:04,214
After all, when you realize
you've crossed a line...

417
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:08,567
That means you still had one.

418
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:14,703
When those crossed lines
are all behind you,

419
00:26:14,747 --> 00:26:17,488
up ahead is only darkness.

420
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:22,798
- He has insomnia,

421
00:26:22,842 --> 00:26:24,321
social anxiety.

422
00:26:24,365 --> 00:26:26,497
I--I don't know
what else to tell you.

423
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:30,371
- Morphine addiction,
jail time, dead daddy.

424
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:33,679
You're giving me
the knockoffs, girl.

425
00:26:33,722 --> 00:26:35,594
I want the brand name.

426
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:41,861
Please let me go.

427
00:26:41,904 --> 00:26:44,646
Whatever you're looking for,
I don't have it.

428
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:48,563
- I know the two of you
had a special relationship.

429
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,743
- "Special"?

430
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,963
He hacked me.

431
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:59,356
He threatened
my last boyfriend.

432
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,620
He threatened me.

433
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,056
You know,
I had to stop seeing him

434
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:04,492
because he scared me so much.

435
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,842
- You weren't scared of him!

436
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:09,279
You loved his ass!

437
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:17,636
I saw the look on your face.

438
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,507
Don't lie to me.

439
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:25,731
- This isn't going to work.

440
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:28,777
Your outbursts.

441
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:31,737
Just because you were bullied
as a kid,

442
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:35,349
because people hurt you--

443
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,307
until that day you swung a bat

444
00:27:37,351 --> 00:27:40,571
and learned
how to hurt them back--

445
00:27:40,615 --> 00:27:44,314
doesn't mean it's going to work
with me.

446
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:58,415
- W-wait a minute.

447
00:28:00,374 --> 00:28:03,072
Wait a fucking second.

448
00:28:04,813 --> 00:28:07,860
Miss Krista, are you...

449
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:10,514
are you calling me
a little bitch?

450
00:28:13,909 --> 00:28:16,825
Yo, Peanuts.

451
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:19,959
You hear that,
what she called me?

452
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,961
- She called youa little bitch.

453
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,615
- Hey, Javi.

454
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,835
You hear her calling me
a little bitch?

455
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,837
- That's what I heard.

456
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,759
See?

457
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:40,066
That's why you're good.

458
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:43,504
Not even my bitch
can call me a little bitch.

459
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:45,680
Oh, my God!

460
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:52,513
Who's that?
- Jason.

461
00:28:57,083 --> 00:28:58,649
- Jason, huh?

462
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:04,003
- That your boy?

463
00:29:04,046 --> 00:29:07,441
Maybe we should
bring him in here.

464
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,835
Maybe that's what'll--
what'll get you going.

465
00:29:09,878 --> 00:29:11,532
- Hello, babe.

466
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,663
Are you in there?

467
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,450
How about that, Miss Krista?

468
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,800
We gon' have
one big merry-merry.

469
00:29:28,941 --> 00:29:31,857
- I was able
to stop the bleeding.

470
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:43,433
- Gonna be okay.

471
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:56,446
I'm sorry.

472
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:08,894
I don't believe you.

473
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,144
You said
the people I work for...

474
00:30:46,714 --> 00:30:49,891
They were behind the massacre
in El Salado?

475
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:00,641
My mom died there.

476
00:31:02,991 --> 00:31:05,298
- I know.

477
00:31:13,654 --> 00:31:15,569
- Olivia...

478
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:22,532
I can stop them.

479
00:31:43,771 --> 00:31:45,294
- Hi.

480
00:31:45,338 --> 00:31:48,994
Um, I'm sorry
to bother you on a holiday,

481
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:52,736
but Mr. Kuklachev
needs the authorization

482
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,130
to transfer funds.

483
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:03,965
You don't see the request?

484
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:05,227
Are you sure?

485
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,852
- I still don't see it.

486
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,767
- Okay, that's strange.

487
00:32:23,811 --> 00:32:26,857
He said it was urgent.

488
00:32:26,901 --> 00:32:29,208
Maybe he changed his mind.

489
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:30,992
I'll just--

490
00:32:31,036 --> 00:32:34,778
I'll just check back with him
and--and get back to you.

491
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,001
Okay, thanks.

492
00:32:42,743 --> 00:32:45,224
Merry Christmas to you too.

493
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,707
- I'll wipe
all the traces of you

494
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:53,623
and your boss's involvement.

495
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,669
Nothing will be linked
back to you.

496
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:02,023
- You know,
I may work for monsters...

497
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,292
But you are one.

498
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:16,690
And you're the worst kind,
because you don't even know it.

499
00:33:48,852 --> 00:33:52,204
Oh, damn.

500
00:33:52,247 --> 00:33:54,423
Your boy's upset
you didn't let him in.

501
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,085
Ah, all right.

502
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,355
Now...

503
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,315
before your boy came and went,

504
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,317
you were calling me
a little bitch?

505
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:24,062
Chill, girl.

506
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,151
I didn't take no offense.

507
00:34:26,194 --> 00:34:29,023
In fact, this was my bad,

508
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,764
'cause I didn't tell you
the whole story.

509
00:34:30,807 --> 00:34:32,026
See,

510
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:36,117
I was just explaining
your role to you.

511
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,772
That you my bat.

512
00:34:40,991 --> 00:34:44,299
But that bat
ain't the end of the story.

513
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:47,259
Nah.

514
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:49,783
That's where I come in.

515
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,313
So after being beaten

516
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:00,533
within an inch of his life

517
00:35:00,576 --> 00:35:05,755
by that badass little bitch,

518
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:08,454
the bully woke up
in the hospital.

519
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:13,198
It was right then
when little bitch walked in

520
00:35:13,241 --> 00:35:16,940
like the fucking ghost
of Xmas past.

521
00:35:16,984 --> 00:35:18,551
Bully sees him
and starts crying.

522
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,161
I mean, this nigga was scared.

523
00:35:20,205 --> 00:35:23,164
He must have thought that boy
had come to finish him off.

524
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:28,213
But you know what happened?

525
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:34,567
Little bitch
just walked right up

526
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:37,526
to his bully's bed...

527
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:44,098
And held his hand.

528
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,056
Yep.

529
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,797
He held his hand...

530
00:35:50,017 --> 00:35:52,324
Just like so.

531
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,112
Real soft and gentle-like.

532
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,811
And then he got real close.

533
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:07,991
He looks at his bully,

534
00:36:08,035 --> 00:36:11,560
all sniffling and crying.

535
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,041
He looked at him and said...

536
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:19,438
"I see you now."

537
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,534
Little bitch showed up
when no one else would.

538
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:30,623
He saw his bully

539
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:34,235
like no one else could...

540
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:37,064
and that was all it took.

541
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,240
And, Miss Krista,

542
00:36:39,284 --> 00:36:41,895
from that moment on,

543
00:36:41,938 --> 00:36:45,203
he owned that bully for life.

544
00:36:50,164 --> 00:36:53,863
Now, if I want to own Elliot,
I don't just gotta break him.

545
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:55,996
Me and Elliot are linked

546
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,433
on a spiritual plane.

547
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:01,306
I got to come at him on
the same level I find myself,

548
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:04,134
and--and breaking him
only gets you so far.

549
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:07,486
I gotta break him
so I can build him up.

550
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:08,965
I need to wound his soul

551
00:37:09,009 --> 00:37:10,489
so I can be the one
to heal him.

552
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,318
That is how you own a nigga.

553
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,105
Now, the next words
out of your mouth

554
00:37:18,148 --> 00:37:20,325
have to be exactly what I want.

555
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:21,978
Not for my sake,

556
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:25,634
but for yours
and for your boy Jason,

557
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:28,942
who lives
up on 1404 Jay Street.

558
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,513
Now, you know what I want.

559
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,343
You got to give it to me.

560
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:48,962
- You do that,

561
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:52,226
I got no reason
not to turn you loose.

562
00:37:57,362 --> 00:37:59,059
Look me in my eye.

563
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,066
Trust me.

564
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,354
Go to the filing cabinet
in my office.

565
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,707
There's a folder
in the bottom drawer.

566
00:38:41,667 --> 00:38:45,192
Go to the tab
that says "September 2015."

567
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:51,111
Look for Elliot's name.

568
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,696
- What am I gonna find there?

569
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:18,225
- Mr. Robot.

570
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:22,708
- What's that?

571
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:27,626
- That...

572
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,324
is how you'll break him.

573
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:51,301
Oh, my head hurts.

574
00:40:06,882 --> 00:40:09,494
I thought
you were gonna kill me.

575
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,713
- They gave me an hour.

576
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:20,374
How long has it been?

577
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,117
- Just unlock your phone.

578
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,425
All they want
is Elliot's location.

579
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,689
- I can't.
- You can.

580
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:32,473
- What would you do
if it was your family?

581
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:34,562
- I'm doing it.

582
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,620
- You know that nightwe spent together?

583
00:40:50,404 --> 00:40:51,797
I know you probably think of it

584
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,452
as the worst nightof your life...

585
00:40:55,801 --> 00:40:57,672
The night all this shitwent to shit.

586
00:40:57,716 --> 00:41:00,545
But when I think about it,it was...

587
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:03,373
- Don't.

588
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,332
- Nice.

589
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,728
The last time I rememberactually feeling good.

590
00:41:14,602 --> 00:41:17,257
You were just using me.

591
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:21,304
- You knowit was more than that.

592
00:41:30,618 --> 00:41:32,664
Look...

593
00:41:32,707 --> 00:41:36,189
whatever you have to do,I get it.

594
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:40,585
Okay? But just--just at least believe that.

595
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:58,254
I'm out of time.

596
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:09,265
Get up.

597
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:13,966
- Where are we going?
- Come on, get up.

598
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:15,837
- Where are we going?
- Up.

599
00:42:15,881 --> 00:42:17,665
Come on, let's go.

600
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,062
You got the jump on me,

601
00:42:23,105 --> 00:42:24,542
and before I knew what was
happening, it was over.

602
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:26,544
- What are you talking about?

603
00:42:26,587 --> 00:42:29,764
- Take it and make it quick.

604
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,679
- You want me to shoot you?
- It's the only way.

605
00:42:31,723 --> 00:42:32,680
Come on,
we're running out of time.

606
00:42:32,724 --> 00:42:33,812
You have to kill me.

607
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,987
- I'm not fuckingkilling you, okay?

608
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,510
Let's go.We can make a run for it.

609
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,772
- If they show up
and we're gone,

610
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:39,295
my family's dead.

611
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:40,819
Don't you get it?

612
00:42:40,862 --> 00:42:44,387
My life puts everyone I love
in danger.

613
00:42:44,431 --> 00:42:46,955
This won't stop until I'm dead.

614
00:42:46,999 --> 00:42:48,740
- I'm not gonnafucking kill you.

615
00:42:48,783 --> 00:42:50,611
- I'd do it myself if I could.

616
00:42:50,655 --> 00:42:52,657
I've thought about it every day
for the past two months,

617
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,919
but I can't do it.

618
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,616
I can't do it.

619
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:57,487
Please, Darlene,
just pull the fucking trigger.

620
00:42:57,531 --> 00:42:58,488
- I can't.

621
00:42:58,532 --> 00:42:59,751
- Just pull
the fucking trigger!

622
00:42:59,794 --> 00:43:01,535
- Dom, please.
- Pull the fucking trigger!

623
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:02,884
- I can't.
- Do it!

624
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:11,632
- Dominique?

625
00:43:16,985 --> 00:43:20,598
Well, now,
I was not expecting this.

626
00:43:21,903 --> 00:43:23,644
I--I'm stunned.

627
00:43:23,688 --> 00:43:25,907
I--I don't know what to say.

628
00:43:25,951 --> 00:43:27,822
My goodness.

629
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:35,700
Oh. Oh, don't worry,
I'm not gonna kill you.

630
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:38,398
You are still far too useful
to us for that.

631
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:43,272
But this is going to be

632
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:47,625
so painful for you.

633
00:43:50,758 --> 00:43:52,630
Now, where's the phone?

634
00:43:59,941 --> 00:44:02,814
I want you to understand,
I mean you no ill will.

635
00:44:02,857 --> 00:44:04,816
My instructions were
to find your brother.

636
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:05,904
- Well, in that case,

637
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:06,905
my phone's not gonna do youany good.

638
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:08,994
I just wiped it.

639
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,007
- Huh.

640
00:44:24,923 --> 00:44:26,838
- Shouldn't we be talking
about what just happened?

641
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:28,404
- We got the access we needed

642
00:44:28,448 --> 00:44:31,016
to transfer the moneyfrom the bank's side.

643
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,540
Once we hack allof the members' phones tonight

644
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,760
at their meeting,we can rob them blind.

645
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:37,413
- That's not what I meant.

646
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:41,896
- What you meantdoesn't matter.

647
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:50,383
Krista?
- Elliot, I need to see you.

648
00:44:50,426 --> 00:44:52,080
- I'm actually kind of busy.Can I call you--

649
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:54,213
- I was kidnapped
by someone you know.

650
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:56,084
Fernando Vera.

651
00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:00,132
He wanted to know everything
about you, everything I knew.

652
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:01,481
I'm sorry,
I didn't know what to do.

653
00:45:01,524 --> 00:45:03,048
I didn't have a choice.
He had a gun.

654
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,397
Once he got what he wanted,
he let me go.

655
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:05,659
I went to the police,

656
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,487
but now I'm too afraid
to go back home.

657
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,141
I'm scared.
- Wait, wait, slow down.

658
00:45:09,184 --> 00:45:11,056
Where are you right now?
- I'm--I don't know.

659
00:45:11,099 --> 00:45:12,274
Downtown, I think.

660
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:14,233
- I can meet you
at Washington Square Park.

661
00:45:14,276 --> 00:45:16,975
Can you get there?
- I think so.

662
00:45:17,018 --> 00:45:19,455
- I'll see you soon.
- Okay.

663
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:24,460
- There's no way
he's just gonna let her go.

664
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,422
- I know.

665
00:45:34,122 --> 00:45:36,298
- Here we go again,
off to play the hero.

666
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:38,866
But is that even
who we are anymore?

667
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,999
You saw what we did
back there.

668
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:44,045
We just watched him
destroy someone's life

669
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:46,091
and none of us
did a thing about it.

670
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,010
Rules, morals, parameters--
they only break

671
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:53,925
if you're broken
to begin with.

672
00:45:53,968 --> 00:45:55,491
Did we change under pressure,

673
00:45:55,535 --> 00:45:58,190
or did this only reveal
who we really are?

674
00:45:58,233 --> 00:45:59,495
I don't know anymore.

675
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:02,281
The one thing I do know is--
- Hey, hey!

676
00:46:05,327 --> 00:46:07,982
Help, help!

677
00:46:08,026 --> 00:46:09,462
Help!

678
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:10,158
Hey!

679
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:12,030
Hey, hey!

680
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:13,205
Help!

681
00:46:15,163 --> 00:46:16,817
Help!

1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:05,657
- When I was a kid
and my dad pushed me

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:07,442
out the window...
- Told you I was sorry.

3
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:09,096
- You're just sick
and don't wanna admit it.

4
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,793
- You weren't pushed.
- Shh.

5
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:12,186
- You jumped.

6
00:00:13,665 --> 00:00:15,102
- We got the access we needed

7
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:16,233
to transfer the money

8
00:00:16,277 --> 00:00:17,539
from the bank's side.

9
00:00:17,582 --> 00:00:19,454
We can rob them blind.

10
00:00:19,497 --> 00:00:20,542
- I don't want Elliot
to be my prisoner.

11
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:22,935
I want him to be my partner.

12
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:25,677
I gotta break him
so I can build him up.

13
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:26,983
I see you now.

14
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,116
That is how you own a nigga.

15
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:31,074
I'm gonna break Elliot,

16
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,250
and you're gonna bemy aluminum bat.

17
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:34,904
- Mr. Robot.

18
00:00:34,947 --> 00:00:37,298
That is how you break him.

19
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,951
Elliot, I was kidnapped.

20
00:00:38,995 --> 00:00:40,127
He wanted to know
everything about you.

21
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:41,432
- The universe got big plans

22
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:43,130
for us, bruh.
- I'm sorry.

23
00:00:43,173 --> 00:00:44,131
I'm scared.

24
00:00:44,174 --> 00:00:46,176
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

25
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:52,704
Boy's not picking up.

26
00:01:21,385 --> 00:01:22,821
-  Okay, okay, okay.

27
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,432
-  I got you, man.

28
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:27,174
I didn't know that.
All right, I got you.

29
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,740
All right.

30
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:35,530
Yeah, you got me confused.

31
00:01:35,573 --> 00:01:37,749
All right.
I got you, bro.

32
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:27,843
- I've been waiting
for this moment

33
00:02:27,886 --> 00:02:29,627
for a while now.

34
00:02:34,502 --> 00:02:36,634
Sorry, just...

35
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:41,944
Didn't expect it to hit melike this.

36
00:02:41,987 --> 00:02:44,729
I'm all emotional and shit.

37
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,601
Told myself I'd keep it cool,you know.

38
00:02:46,644 --> 00:02:48,951
Told myself I wouldn't dono fanboy shit like this,

39
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,300
but I'm sorry, dude.

40
00:02:50,344 --> 00:02:51,823
I just have so much respectfor your ass,

41
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,303
it makes me all...

42
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:58,134
Yo, what's that word
those weird-ass Hasids use

43
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,831
for this shit?

44
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,093
- Mm, "verklempt"?

45
00:03:01,137 --> 00:03:02,530
- That's it, verklempt.

46
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:06,708
You--well...

47
00:03:08,144 --> 00:03:09,798
You like a hero to me.

48
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:14,455
A hero I did wrong,not gonna lipstick that pig.

49
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:17,022
But it was a turning pointin my story nonetheless.

50
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,937
And something tells meit was a turning point

51
00:03:18,981 --> 00:03:20,765
in your story too.

52
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:33,865
Javi, make our guest here
more comfortable.

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:48,402
- We're on the second floor
of a three-story walk-up,

54
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:50,534
two armed dopes
and a crazy meth head

55
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,188
who thinks he's Deepak Chopra.

56
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,276
Only exit's the front door,

57
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,669
but I seem to remember

58
00:03:54,712 --> 00:03:55,974
there's a fire escape
in the back.

59
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:57,149
- Not thinking about

60
00:03:57,193 --> 00:03:58,499
an escape plan right now.

61
00:03:58,542 --> 00:03:59,804
- Escape is the only
fucking thing

62
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,284
we should be thinking about.

63
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:03,155
- Not until we find Krista.

64
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,549
- Kiddo, need I remind you

65
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:07,725
about Dominican Psycho
over here?

66
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:11,076
Krista was just bait.
Now she's probably dead.

67
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,209
- Well, we need to find out.

68
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:17,039
I just need to get him doing
what he loves to do best: talk.

69
00:04:17,082 --> 00:04:19,389
He'll tell us what we want--
- Yo!

70
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:21,086
You gonna say something?

71
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,396
It's been a minute.

72
00:04:28,093 --> 00:04:29,573
How the fuck you been?

73
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,710
- Truth is,
I'm--I'm a little confused.

74
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,235
You came looking for me
two months ago.

75
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,759
Why'd you wait until today
to make a move?

76
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,588
- Well, if you must know,

77
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:48,462
I had to prepare,
set the stage for our meet.

78
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:53,075
This shit is biggerthan Frost-Nixon, you know?

79
00:04:54,946 --> 00:04:56,208
Had to be ready.

80
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,431
- Ready for what?

81
00:05:04,086 --> 00:05:06,001
- For you, bruh.

82
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:09,178
You a formidable adversary.

83
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:12,355
You ain't no corner bitch
I can stick my dick in.

84
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,618
Need to buy you dinner first.

85
00:05:17,578 --> 00:05:19,841
- That what this is, dinner?

86
00:05:19,884 --> 00:05:23,105
- Shit, nigga,
he trying to make a metaphor.

87
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,933
Yo, V, I thought you said
this kid a genius, bro.

88
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,588
- I swear to God, if you don'tshut the fuck up--

89
00:05:27,631 --> 00:05:29,198
- How about we just cut
the bullshit

90
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,939
and you tell me why I'm here?

91
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,131
- After our unfortunate...

92
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:51,089
parting of ways,

93
00:05:51,133 --> 00:05:53,309
I had to return back home
to the DR.

94
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,398
Hadn't been back there
since I was little...

95
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,141
When people didn't think
much of me.

96
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:03,493
It actually reminded me
of a dream I used to have,

97
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,669
that I would one day
own that island,

98
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:08,890
that the very land
everyone walked on,

99
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:12,154
slept on, fucked on
would be mine.

100
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:15,200
- Settle in, this looks like
it's gonna be a long one.

101
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,120
- Except there I was,

102
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:24,775
back in the DRwith those same motherfuckers

103
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,516
who didn't believe in me...

104
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,171
said I wouldn't amountto nothing.

105
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:31,347
This time, they was wrong.

106
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,783
I had tools now.

107
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,394
I had visionI didn't have before.

108
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,743
So I started hustling.

109
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,921
I set up shop...

110
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,357
couple of cornershere and there.

111
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,315
At first, on my own.

112
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:46,406
Then a few other niggasgot impressed, joined in.

113
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:47,885
Couple of block battles

114
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,800
but nothingwe couldn't handle.

115
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:53,021
Matter of fact,it was easier than ever.

116
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:58,374
And like a virus,we multiplied.

117
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:04,249
Within 43 days,I took down every gang.

118
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,255
From there, it was easyto get to the politicians,

119
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:14,172
especially with Five/Ninepounding their wallets.

120
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:16,392
Once that domino fell,we took control

121
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:20,657
of all the favelas in boththe Dominican and Haiti.

122
00:07:24,226 --> 00:07:26,184
- I was running everything
and everyone

123
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:28,448
from the president
to the campesino.

124
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:30,014
And by day 87,

125
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:32,277
I finally had my own island.

126
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:37,631
Then on the 88th day,

127
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,110
I got bored.

128
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,896
I had everything I ever wanted,

129
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:44,202
but all I felt was emptiness.

130
00:07:46,596 --> 00:07:47,728
One day, Javi over here

131
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,599
brings this crazy old shaman

132
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:51,471
who says he can help me.

133
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:53,864
So I said,
"All right, let him in."

134
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:56,954
He sat my ass down,
prepared me a cocktail

135
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,652
of this powder--pink powder,

136
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:01,698
red blood mixed in
with titty milk.

137
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:04,440
He looked into my eyes
and said,

138
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,573
"You're asleep.

139
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:08,749
It's time you wake up."

140
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,536
Then held the cup to my lips.

141
00:08:17,148 --> 00:08:19,760
You wanna know what I did,Elliot?

142
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:23,111
I gulped that shit down.

143
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:25,592
And then--

144
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,550
I just gotta be real
with you, bruh--

145
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,944
I shit myself.

146
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,554
Then I puked myself.

147
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:34,252
Back and forth, back and forth,
shitting, puking,

148
00:08:34,296 --> 00:08:37,473
till all the shit and pukepoured out of me.

149
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:42,565
The shaman then takes my facein his hands, says...

150
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:45,263
"It's time for you to go home."

151
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:51,487
I didn't know what to think.

152
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,837
I told him...

153
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:56,100
I was home.

154
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:59,843
And then it hit mewhy I was feeling empty

155
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,367
that whole time.

156
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,587
Home isn't where you from.

157
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:07,938
It's...where you supposed
to be.

158
00:09:10,854 --> 00:09:14,336
I was born Dominican,
but here...

159
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,558
New York...

160
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,609
This is my home.

161
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,829
This is where I thrived.

162
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:31,919
And there I laid,weeping like a bitch,

163
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,442
telling the shamanI could never go back.

164
00:09:33,485 --> 00:09:35,923
I failed there.
That path was closed to me.

165
00:09:35,966 --> 00:09:38,665
Shaman shook his head no.

166
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:45,541
Told me I had to reopen
that path,

167
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,022
that I had to reconcile

168
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,850
with the man who closed it.

169
00:09:49,893 --> 00:09:54,419
For he was meant to be
my partner.

170
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,423
Then and only then
can I go home again.

171
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:07,432
That's why we sitting hereright now, Elliot.

172
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:11,088
That's why I came back.

173
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,396
I owned the wrong island.

174
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,270
I'm gonna take over New York,

175
00:10:19,314 --> 00:10:23,231
and you gonna be my side
when I do.

176
00:10:29,977 --> 00:10:31,892
So what you think?

177
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,421
- Where's Krista?

178
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:59,354
You want me to partner with you
for anything,

179
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:02,270
first things first,
I need to know where Krista is.

180
00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:06,056
- You forget we played
this game already?

181
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,363
- That's why I'm asking.

182
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:18,765
Now that I think about it,
this was Isaac's knife.

183
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:20,549
You remember him, don't you?

184
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,030
My brother.

185
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:28,339
This is probably the same onehe did your girl Shayla with.

186
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:37,914
- No one here wants to see
no rerun, bruh.

187
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,529
- You're not gonna kill Krista.

188
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,489
She's the only thing
you got over me.

189
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,450
Can't believe,
with all that enlightenment,

190
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,670
you'd come back here
to be just as stupid

191
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,280
as you were last time.

192
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,979
- Stupid?

193
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:02,330
Last time we did this dance,

194
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,549
I got everything I wanted,
didn't I?

195
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:08,989
- You didn't get me.

196
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:19,869
Where is she?

197
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,612
- She good, bruh.

198
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,703
- Show me.

199
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:45,416
- Poor Elliot...

200
00:12:47,592 --> 00:12:50,944
Always caught upworrying about the pussy.

201
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,600
Is that all you want?

202
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:59,126
Simple meet and greet?

203
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,086
Okay.

204
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,350
But then after that,

205
00:13:06,394 --> 00:13:09,745
I'm gonna want my ownspecial introduction.

206
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,459
- Elliot.
- Are you okay?

207
00:13:28,503 --> 00:13:30,505
- No, no, no, no, we ain't
having no sidebar here.

208
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:32,376
Alls I said was
you could see her.

209
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,904
- You need to let her go.

210
00:13:37,947 --> 00:13:39,949
- You already
on to your second demand

211
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,733
and you ain't even honored
the first.

212
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,998
I said I need an introduction.

213
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,960
- What introduction?

214
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,102
- Mr. Robot.

215
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:12,939
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

216
00:14:12,982 --> 00:14:14,114
- Nah, come on, dude.

217
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,550
Let's move past the bullshit.

218
00:14:15,593 --> 00:14:17,421
I got your therapist here,
remember?

219
00:14:17,465 --> 00:14:19,554
I know everything about you.

220
00:14:21,991 --> 00:14:24,820
So tell me,
how do we get him out?

221
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:29,825
How does this voodoo shit work,
exactly?

222
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,959
Do we say "Mr. Robot"
three times in the mirror?

223
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,395
Rub a lamp?

224
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,266
Roll your eyes back,
play Bob Marley,

225
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,007
light some candles?

226
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,617
- What do you want from him?

227
00:14:39,661 --> 00:14:42,011
- Alls I wanna do
is talk to him.

228
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:45,232
- How 'bout you let her go
and then we'll talk?

229
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:52,674
Remember what I said,
anything happens to her...

230
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:54,632
Don't touch her!

231
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,460
- Don't worry,
I'm not touching.

232
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:00,247
I'm just taking
her temperature.

233
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:02,989
But Javi over here,

234
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:04,512
he just got out of a bad
relationship.

235
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:06,340
He need a rebound.

236
00:15:06,383 --> 00:15:08,037
- He been looking
at Miss Krista all day

237
00:15:08,081 --> 00:15:09,909
with them hungry eyes.

238
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:11,432
He gotta eat sometime.

239
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:13,434
You can't blame him, can you?

240
00:15:13,477 --> 00:15:15,697
We all gotta eat, Elliot.

241
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,090
- You wanna talk?

242
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,572
Let's talk.

243
00:15:28,623 --> 00:15:32,844
- How do I know it's you?
I didn't see no puff of smoke.

244
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:35,935
- Let's get one thing straight,
fuck-face.

245
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:37,980
I ain't no puff of smoke.

246
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:57,043
- Welcome to the party,Mr. Robot.

247
00:15:57,086 --> 00:15:59,262
- I'm not here to party.

248
00:15:59,306 --> 00:16:01,090
You wanna talk,
get to it already.

249
00:16:01,134 --> 00:16:03,571
What do you want?
- Yo.

250
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:05,007
I don't care who the fuck
you are.

251
00:16:05,051 --> 00:16:06,052
You need to calm it down,
homey.

252
00:16:06,095 --> 00:16:07,836
- I'm not talking to you.

253
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:15,670
- Where that courage now,
bitch?

254
00:16:19,021 --> 00:16:21,110
Right fucking here.

255
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:25,897
- Let's keep this friendly.

256
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:26,898
- Yo, V, I ain't trying--

257
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:27,943
- Peanuts, God damn it,

258
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,684
I said put the gun down!

259
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,131
- What kind of name
is Mr. Robot anyway?

260
00:16:42,175 --> 00:16:44,264
Some Nickelodeon bullshit, man.

261
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:48,790
- What kind of operation
you running here, exactly?

262
00:16:55,275 --> 00:16:57,755
- What's so funny?
- Nothing, man.

263
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,192
It's just a trip.

264
00:16:59,235 --> 00:17:01,411
It's like I'm really talkingto another person.

265
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,152
- That's because you are.

266
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:05,981
So stop wasting my time,
and start talking.

267
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,461
- I thought we was talking.

268
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,289
- What am I doing here?

269
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,421
- I don't know.

270
00:17:11,465 --> 00:17:13,728
That's a good question.

271
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:25,522
Why...are...you...

272
00:17:28,786 --> 00:17:30,701
Here?

273
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,577
- When assholes like you
come around,

274
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,493
I make sure he has someone
on his side.

275
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:42,278
- Oh, what that make you, then,the muscle?

276
00:17:42,322 --> 00:17:43,975
His protection?

277
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:45,934
- Something like that.

278
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:54,073
- How you think that's going?

279
00:18:01,428 --> 00:18:03,517
Don't matter, though.

280
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,085
I ain't here to judge
your job performance.

281
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:11,351
I didn't ask what you do.
I asked you why you were here.

282
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:15,181
How did you start?

283
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,580
- He needed me.
- Why?

284
00:18:24,581 --> 00:18:25,756
If you here to protect him,

285
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,845
that means he got hurt
real bad.

286
00:18:27,889 --> 00:18:29,673
I just wanna know
what scared him so much

287
00:18:29,717 --> 00:18:32,285
that he needed your bitch ass
to come to the rescue.

288
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,724
- This is cute and all,
but I gotta be real with you.

289
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:41,468
You're too stupid to do this.

290
00:18:41,511 --> 00:18:42,643
- What is it that you think
I'm doing, exactly?

291
00:18:42,686 --> 00:18:44,297
- Trying to get inside my head.

292
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,646
- Oh, I already in there.

293
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:47,038
- You're so sure of yourself.

294
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,170
- I am.
- Why's that?

295
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,172
- 'Cause there's a method

296
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,608
to Elliot's madness,

297
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:54,002
and I think you know
what it is.

298
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:56,004
- You wanna know what it is?

299
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,049
I'll tell you what it is.

300
00:18:58,093 --> 00:18:59,399
He's smart.
He's angry.

301
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:00,748
Put those two things together,

302
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,489
you stay the fuck out
of the way.

303
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:03,751
- Yeah, blah, blah, blah,
that's your spin zone

304
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:05,361
"Fox & Friends."

305
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,798
How 'bout you give me
the real headline?

306
00:19:10,497 --> 00:19:13,761
- You read her file.
Put two and two together.

307
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:16,503
His father died when he was
eight years old.

308
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:20,202
His mother treated him
like her own personal ashtray.

309
00:19:20,246 --> 00:19:22,291
He needed someone to help him
cope with the world.

310
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:23,553
Voilà, you got me.

311
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:25,120
- No doubt, shit's heavy,

312
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,556
but it ain't actionable.

313
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,254
I need details.

314
00:19:28,297 --> 00:19:30,647
- How 'bout we skip
the psychobabble

315
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:32,997
and get to why
we're really here?

316
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:36,392
You said you wanna own
this island

317
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,481
and you need my help.

318
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:43,225
So this job interview
isn't about my credentials.

319
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,096
It's about yours.

320
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,795
And like I said,
with your operation,

321
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:49,362
I don't know if you could run
a White Castle,

322
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:50,624
much less New York.

323
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,103
You want me to work for you.

324
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:54,628
It's clear you don't wanna
force me into it,

325
00:19:54,671 --> 00:19:57,631
which means you gotta start
convincing me.

326
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,505
- Convincing you?

327
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,465
- Let's not play dumb.

328
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:09,817
If she told you about me,

329
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,515
I gotta think she told you
about Five/Nine.

330
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:16,432
So you know the things
I've done,

331
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:18,826
things I've been able
to pull off.

332
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,264
I'm not someone
you push around with a gun.

333
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,787
I am the gun.

334
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:27,661
So yeah,
you gotta convince me.

335
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,490
Because right now,

336
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,405
if this is your master vision,

337
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,145
do yourself a favor.

338
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:36,060
Go back to that
little shaman of yours

339
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:38,019
and shit some more,
because you're clearly

340
00:20:38,062 --> 00:20:39,368
still full of it.

341
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:51,641
- I wanna own every corner
of this city.

342
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,559
I want them all
pushing my product.

343
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:58,866
And I mean everyone,
not just no drug dealers.

344
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:01,216
Every business,
every storefront,

345
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,219
every billboard in this city,
every train in every tunnel,

346
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,829
every pig in blue.

347
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,005
From the night whores
walking the streets

348
00:21:08,049 --> 00:21:10,356
to the day whores
on the Upper East Side,

349
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,750
from the rapists down in lockup
to the ones in the high-rises.

350
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:17,711
I wanna roll five boroughs
into one Dominican blunt,

351
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:20,583
smoke that shit
as I count my cash

352
00:21:20,627 --> 00:21:23,586
and ash on these Warbuckses'
white, bald heads.

353
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,067
That is my master vision,

354
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:30,245
and that...Mr. Robot,

355
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,333
is what I want.

356
00:21:31,377 --> 00:21:33,466
I wanna own this island.

357
00:21:38,427 --> 00:21:40,429
- So let me see if I got this.

358
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:44,433
You wanna get into real estate.

359
00:21:45,608 --> 00:21:46,827
Is that it?

360
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:49,264
Is that what all this is about?

361
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,920
Is that really your
groundbreaking epiphany here?

362
00:21:52,963 --> 00:21:54,965
No.

363
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,968
That can't really be it, is it?

364
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,754
In your word salad,

365
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,364
I heard something
about drug dealing.

366
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:05,019
Thing is, Pfizer and Eli
are a few billion ahead of you,

367
00:22:05,062 --> 00:22:07,238
and they can buy your death
with the same half-cent

368
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:09,371
it costs them to make a pill.

369
00:22:09,415 --> 00:22:10,416
You wanna get
into billboards?

370
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,765
Download Photoshop.

371
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,115
Make yourself
a cute portfolio.

372
00:22:14,158 --> 00:22:16,900
Stores,
with the debt everyone's in,

373
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,728
I'm sure they'llgladly give 'em to you,

374
00:22:18,772 --> 00:22:21,601
in which case, you'll justbe owned by their banks.

375
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:23,167
Trains are even more bankrupt,

376
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:25,648
and don't even get me startedon the NYPD.

377
00:22:25,692 --> 00:22:27,998
Even that blunt you wanna rollis gonna be marked up

378
00:22:28,042 --> 00:22:29,652
by Big Tobacco itself.

379
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:33,090
Point is, this city's onebig, fat credit card bill,

380
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:35,397
and you wanna pay it,all so you can, what,

381
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,443
be another suitwith a mortgage?

382
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,447
Unless you're aftera monopoly on stupidity,

383
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,884
please tell me you have more.

384
00:22:43,927 --> 00:22:46,103
Please tell me you didn'twaste my time

385
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,062
when you could have justenrolled in some night classes

386
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:49,716
at the Brooklyn Schoolof Real Estate

387
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:51,674
and left me the fuck out of it.

388
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:56,026
- This ain't about being
no landlord, bruh.

389
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,941
This is about power.

390
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:01,597
- Power is just an assholestuffed with money.

391
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,556
And while you're most
definitely all stocked up

392
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:05,993
on asshole,
money, you just don't got.

393
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:07,777
- I gots plenty
start-up capital.

394
00:23:07,821 --> 00:23:09,300
- Whatever you have
isn't enough, not for this.

395
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:11,128
- Ain't no thing.
I can stick up a few joints.

396
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:12,173
How much we talking?

397
00:23:12,216 --> 00:23:13,392
- Even asking that means

398
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,350
you're thinking too small.

399
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,484
Behind every great fortune,
there lies a great crime.

400
00:23:18,527 --> 00:23:21,530
That is the corporate motto
of these United States.

401
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:24,664
You wanna oink-oink with all
the other capitalist pigs?

402
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:26,666
It's not about how much money.

403
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:29,799
It's about robbing moneyitself.

404
00:23:35,544 --> 00:23:37,503
- And you can do that for me?

405
00:23:39,026 --> 00:23:41,115
- I think I have a planthat could help you.

406
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,771
But step one of anythingwe do together

407
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:46,468
is always gonna belet her go.

408
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,519
- But didn't you say she was
the only thing I got over you?

409
00:23:57,305 --> 00:24:01,918
Javi, Peanuts, am I deaf,or did he not say that?

410
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,486
- Yeah, I heard it.

411
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,357
- Yeah, I heard it,most definitely.

412
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:10,666
Hey, you need to recollectcorrect, Nickelodeon.

413
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,583
- So if I let my only
insurance policy go,

414
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:16,063
then how am I gonna trust

415
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,108
that this money
gonna come to me

416
00:24:18,152 --> 00:24:21,416
or that this plan of yours
even exists in the first place?

417
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:25,681
You know, come to think of it,
she didn't even trust you.

418
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:27,466
It was in her notes.

419
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,251
- Ain't that true, Miss Krista?

420
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:32,775
- What was it again?
How'd phrase it?

421
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:35,909
"Patient is extremely guarded,

422
00:24:35,952 --> 00:24:39,608
which presents a barrier
to honest processing."

423
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,699
That don't sound too good,
Mr. Robot.

424
00:24:46,267 --> 00:24:49,139
If she can't trust you,
why should I?

425
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:52,447
- I'll show you.

426
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:02,675
- Show me what?

427
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:04,459
- My plan,

428
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,287
the hack.

429
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:07,897
It's going down tonight.

430
00:25:09,116 --> 00:25:10,639
You let me do it,
I'll steal more money

431
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:12,423
than you know what to do with.

432
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:15,644
That'll be a better partner
to you than anyone else.

433
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:21,607
- Why you willing to part
with all this dough?

434
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,130
- I don't give a shit
about money.

435
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:25,393
I just wanna take it from them.

436
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:32,095
- How exactly
you gonna do that?

437
00:25:34,837 --> 00:25:36,273
- I'll show you.

438
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:44,586
I got it all on my laptop:

439
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:48,416
bank statements,
account balances,

440
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,113
the whole exploit.

441
00:25:55,815 --> 00:25:58,905
- Javi, go get his bag.

442
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:23,886
You know,
you don't need Mr. Robot.

443
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,329
He barks a lot,

444
00:26:32,373 --> 00:26:33,853
but he ain't the bite

445
00:26:33,896 --> 00:26:36,203
behind all that havoc
you wreaked, is he?

446
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,733
See, that right there,
that's why you my dude.

447
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:47,780
I'm more scared of you
than him.

448
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:54,395
You got something to show me,

449
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:56,266
then let the show begin.

450
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:03,507
Look at all them zeros.

451
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:04,944
I can't even count 'em all.

452
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,558
- Oh, yeah,
that's stadium money, nigga.

453
00:28:10,601 --> 00:28:12,342
- The fuck is stadium money?

454
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:16,085
-  Yo.

455
00:28:18,087 --> 00:28:21,003
Yo, Javi, come take a look.

456
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:29,098
- Oh, shit.

457
00:28:29,925 --> 00:28:32,406
Yo, you right,
that is stadium money.

458
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,364
- Bro, oh.

459
00:28:53,122 --> 00:28:54,950
- You don't got it in you.

460
00:29:13,273 --> 00:29:16,232
I got your bullets, bitch.

461
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:24,763
- You really think I didn'thave Javi check your bag

462
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,547
the second we grabbed you?

463
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,204
Oh.

464
00:29:31,247 --> 00:29:34,424
Maybe I was wrongabout you, bruh.

465
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,601
Old Elliot never would havepicked up that gun,

466
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:38,907
let alone pulled the trigger.

467
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:40,953
I like to think I hadsomething to do

468
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,042
with that little mean streakin you.

469
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:45,566
You make me proud,

470
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,960
but I can see we still havesome work to do.

471
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:51,354
- It wasn't him. It was me.
It was my fuckup.

472
00:29:51,398 --> 00:29:52,878
You don't need
to take it out on him.

473
00:29:52,921 --> 00:29:54,488
- Take it out on you, him,

474
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:55,837
the fuck does it matter?

475
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,491
Same brain gets the bullet,
don't it?

476
00:29:57,534 --> 00:29:58,666
- I had a lapse,
doesn't mean you give up

477
00:29:58,709 --> 00:29:59,972
on all those zeros.

478
00:30:00,015 --> 00:30:00,929
That's still very fucking real.

479
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:01,974
- Nah, man.

480
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:03,062
None of this is real,

481
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,585
not until we have trust.

482
00:30:04,628 --> 00:30:06,065
- We can figure this out.
You just gotta

483
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:07,849
put the gun down.

484
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:10,286
- Stop being so thirsty, bruh.

485
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,680
I ain't trying to talk to ya
anyway.

486
00:30:14,116 --> 00:30:15,770
- Where you going?

487
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,556
- Let's go, sweet thing.

488
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,646
- Let's go.

489
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:27,521
- Wait, stop.

490
00:30:27,564 --> 00:30:29,262
You wanna throw awayall that money for nothing?

491
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:30,611
- I'm not the one
who just tried to shoot me

492
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:32,308
for no goddamn reason.

493
00:30:32,352 --> 00:30:34,267
- No goddamn reason? You would
have done the same thing.

494
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,008
- Incorrecto,cuz.

495
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:37,879
I would have made sureto kill your ass,

496
00:30:37,923 --> 00:30:39,620
like I'm about to do to her.

497
00:30:39,663 --> 00:30:41,927
- Hey, you hurt her,
you might as well kill me next.

498
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:43,319
You lose everything.

499
00:30:43,363 --> 00:30:46,192
- That does appear to bethe pickle we're in.

500
00:30:46,235 --> 00:30:48,847
So what to do?What to do?

501
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,023
- We go back to the plan
before I fucked everything up.

502
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:53,982
- Yesterday's news, bruh.Been there, done that.

503
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:55,636
- Wait! Wait, wait!

504
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,508
After I steal the money,
I'll be your partner, okay?

505
00:30:58,552 --> 00:31:00,684
I will be your partner.
I will do whatever you want.

506
00:31:00,728 --> 00:31:02,556
- Warmer, but not quite theresince I know for sure

507
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,905
I can't trust you.

508
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,080
- Wait, wait, wait!
There's gotta be

509
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:06,299
something we can figure out!

510
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:07,474
- Tell me why I shouldn'tshoot her.

511
00:31:07,517 --> 00:31:09,215
- Because she's a good person.

512
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,738
- No, tell me whyI shouldn't shoot her.

513
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:11,957
- She doesn't deserve this!

514
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,480
- Details, motherfucker!

515
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:15,656
Tell me why I shouldn'tshoot her!

516
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:17,136
- Because I need her!

517
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,101
She helps me.

518
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:34,718
- Oh...I get it now.

519
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:38,070
She your shaman.

520
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,726
- The fuck does that mean?

521
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:47,644
- It means now we're getting
much warmer.

522
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:50,386
See, I've been going about this
the wrong way.

523
00:31:51,213 --> 00:31:54,434
I thought you would give me
the answer I was looking for.

524
00:31:57,045 --> 00:31:59,700
But maybe I was
the wrong person

525
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:01,484
asking the question.

526
00:32:18,719 --> 00:32:20,068
- Have a seat, bruh.

527
00:32:22,331 --> 00:32:24,029
- What is this?

528
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:26,596
- We gonna have a littletherapy session.

529
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,034
It's finally time you sawthat you and I

530
00:32:29,077 --> 00:32:31,123
are destined to be partners.

531
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:33,777
You ready?

532
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:37,868
Didn't I tell you
to sit your ass down?

533
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:43,396
We gonna find out
what's going on

534
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,267
inside that little head
of yours.

535
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,357
Ain't that right, honey bear?

536
00:32:49,445 --> 00:32:51,578
- What do you expect me to do,exactly?

537
00:32:51,621 --> 00:32:54,711
- I expect you to pick up
where you last left off.

538
00:32:58,063 --> 00:32:59,499
Why you looking at me
like that?

539
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:01,196
Don't you do this for a living?

540
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,677
- Yes, but--
- I don't wanna hear no buts.

541
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,853
Alls I wanna hear
is this therapy session

542
00:33:05,896 --> 00:33:07,028
getting kicked off.

543
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:12,860
- You sick, sadisticpiece of shit.

544
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,514
What's the point of this?

545
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,820
You're just gonna kill usanyway.

546
00:33:16,864 --> 00:33:19,388
- It's fine, Krista.
Let's just do what he wants.

547
00:33:19,432 --> 00:33:21,216
- Elliot, he's just trying tofind another way to hurt you.

548
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,262
- He just wants a show.

549
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:24,785
Let's give him a show.

550
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:25,829
- That's right.

551
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,011
I'll be sitting right here,

552
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,534
eating my popcorn.

553
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:39,278
- What you're asking foris impossible.

554
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,802
You won't get anythingout of this.

555
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:46,111
This only worksin a controlled setting,

556
00:33:46,154 --> 00:33:48,200
alone,

557
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:50,941
just me and him.

558
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:58,123
- Peanuts, Javi, take a walk.

559
00:33:58,166 --> 00:33:59,472
- What?

560
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,996
Nah, nigga.

561
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,085
Now I wanna know what happens.

562
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:05,565
- Yeah, dawg,
I'm kinda curious

563
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:06,653
where you going
with all of this.

564
00:34:06,696 --> 00:34:09,003
- I said take a fucking walk!

565
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,754
- Nasty cabbage ass,

566
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:22,886
had to go on
and ruin everything.

567
00:34:32,374 --> 00:34:35,247
- That's as alone
as you gonna get.

568
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,987
- That's not what I meant,and you know it.

569
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:38,380
You're pointing a gun at me.

570
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:39,773
You're forcing me to talkto one of my pati--

571
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:41,035
Ah!

572
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,732
- Okay, okay, calm down.

573
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,909
Krista, look at me.

574
00:34:47,302 --> 00:34:50,044
- Ask me some questions.
It's easy.

575
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,264
You know how to do this,
same as we always do.

576
00:34:55,049 --> 00:34:56,920
Come on, Krista.

577
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:59,140
It's fine.
Pretend he's not even here.

578
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:01,577
- Listen to your boy.

579
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,884
- Come on, you can do it.

580
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:05,538
Look at me.

581
00:35:05,581 --> 00:35:07,496
Let's talk about my mom.

582
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,369
She just passed away.

583
00:35:10,412 --> 00:35:11,892
Why don't we talk about that?

584
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,984
- Are you okay?

585
00:35:17,027 --> 00:35:19,117
- I'm fine.

586
00:35:20,248 --> 00:35:24,600
You know we didn't talk a lot,
so it didn't hit me that hard.

587
00:35:26,298 --> 00:35:28,561
I think it got to Darlene,
though.

588
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,740
Come on, keep going.

589
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:36,438
There's gotta be something more
you wanna ask me.

590
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:41,269
- Now that you've had some timeto think about it...

591
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:45,360
How are you feelingabout her death?

592
00:35:47,623 --> 00:35:49,712
- I haven't thought about it
that much.

593
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,759
Is that a bad thing?

594
00:35:54,891 --> 00:35:57,590
- Well, there wasa lot of pain there.

595
00:35:57,633 --> 00:36:00,288
She hurt you--
- Yeah, yeah!

596
00:36:00,332 --> 00:36:03,683
I know all this.
That's all old shit.

597
00:36:03,726 --> 00:36:07,687
There's no gold there.I need that 24-karat.

598
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:10,211
- I don't know how to dowhat you want.

599
00:36:10,255 --> 00:36:11,604
- You said Elliot's got
a secret

600
00:36:11,647 --> 00:36:13,040
and the only way
I can unlock it

601
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:15,390
is to find out
why Mr. Robot exists.

602
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:22,005
- What's he talking about?

603
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:25,618
- She sold us out
is what he's talking about.

604
00:36:25,661 --> 00:36:27,315
- I'm sorry.I had to tell him something.

605
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,795
I didn't know what else to say.

606
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:32,973
- What did you tell him?

607
00:36:33,016 --> 00:36:34,844
- Look, we are running
out of time here.

608
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:36,455
We gotta start thinking
about an exit strategy

609
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:38,674
and fast,
while his pals are gone.

610
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,502
- Do you know
what she's talking about?

611
00:36:40,546 --> 00:36:41,721
- What does it matter?
Did you hear what I said?

612
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:43,592
We gotta get out of here.
- Here.

613
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,333
Let me help you start.
- Those are my private charts.

614
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:46,943
- "Elliot's preoccupation
with Mr. Robot

615
00:36:46,987 --> 00:36:48,467
"suggests an emotional
component

616
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,555
to the relationship"--
- Don't do this.

617
00:36:49,598 --> 00:36:51,470
- Oh, you upset.
I'm sorry.

618
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,950
Maybe I should stop.
How 'bout it, Elliot?

619
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:56,475
You sure you don't wanna know
what she wrote in here?

620
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:57,998
- He's fucking with you.

621
00:36:58,041 --> 00:36:59,391
He's trying to play
his little mind games.

622
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:03,569
- She doesn't want me
to hear this.

623
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,530
Why?

624
00:37:08,574 --> 00:37:10,663
- Who gives a shit?

625
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,665
We gotta focus on a way
out of here.

626
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:16,886
- You don't want me
to hear this either.

627
00:37:21,282 --> 00:37:22,979
Keep reading.

628
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:25,330
- No, don't do this.Elliot, it's not a good idea.

629
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:28,071
- I said keep reading.

630
00:37:28,115 --> 00:37:29,943
- Ooh, I like this one.

631
00:37:29,986 --> 00:37:32,728
"Strained relationship
with Mr. Robot...

632
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:37,037
keeps us from exploring
the root of his condition."

633
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,647
- What does that mean?

634
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:41,520
- Answer the man's question.

635
00:37:41,563 --> 00:37:43,522
- Tell me what that means.

636
00:37:43,565 --> 00:37:45,698
- Elliot, this is nothow this is supposed to work.

637
00:37:45,741 --> 00:37:47,352
- She's right.
This--this has to stop.

638
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:48,527
- "Childhood trauma,

639
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,180
follow up on window event."

640
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,187
What's so important
about this window anyway?

641
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,542
You won't talk.

642
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,326
No problem.
Let me look it up.

643
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,719
Let's see, window...
- Stop it.

644
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:09,069
Just stop it!These are just my notes.

645
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:11,245
You're not supposed to hearany of this in this way.

646
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:14,248
- I don't give a shit
what I'm supposed to hear.

647
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,554
What are you hiding?

648
00:38:18,121 --> 00:38:19,775
Is this about Mr. Robot?

649
00:38:22,038 --> 00:38:24,040
- No, not Mr. Robot.

650
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,260
- Darlene?

651
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,479
- No.

652
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:29,132
- Who, then?

653
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:30,612
- Don't say anything.

654
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:32,745
- What does this have to do
with the window?

655
00:38:32,788 --> 00:38:34,616
No one was there
except my father.

656
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:38,664
Is this about my father?

657
00:38:42,232 --> 00:38:44,017
What about him?
- Please don't make me do this.

658
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,932
- What about him?
- Don't make me do this.

659
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:48,761
- Krista, don't.
- Shut up.

660
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:52,068
Krista,
there's no use holding back.

661
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:53,722
Tell me what's going on.

662
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:58,771
- The day he pushed youout the window--

663
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,903
- My dad didn't push me.
I--I jumped.

664
00:39:00,947 --> 00:39:02,862
Darlene told me.
I remembered it wrong.

665
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:05,430
- See, she doesn't even know--
- I said shut up!

666
00:39:09,651 --> 00:39:12,306
Keep going.
- Let's get it, bruh.

667
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:18,181
- Why is it you thinkyou--you can't recall

668
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,183
that memory so clearly?

669
00:39:22,664 --> 00:39:24,405
- Pay attention.

670
00:39:24,449 --> 00:39:26,364
Miss Krista's asking you
questions.

671
00:39:26,407 --> 00:39:29,018
- I don't know why.
Do you?

672
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:34,850
Answer me.
- I--I--I don't know.

673
00:39:34,894 --> 00:39:37,418
But I...

674
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,594
I can ask you detailsabout that day

675
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,204
to help you remember.

676
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,032
- Like what?

677
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:46,819
- What were you doingthat day in your room?

678
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:50,649
- Uh...Darlene and I
were building a snowman.

679
00:39:50,692 --> 00:39:53,391
We went upstairs
to look for my camera.

680
00:39:53,434 --> 00:39:55,915
- And did you find the camera?

681
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:58,787
- Darlene told me we didn't.

682
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,008
- What else did Darlene say?

683
00:40:02,051 --> 00:40:06,578
- She said...that we heard
my dad coming

684
00:40:06,621 --> 00:40:08,928
and I told her to hide
in the closet.

685
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:12,279
- Then what happened?

686
00:40:14,368 --> 00:40:18,241
- Uh, he walked in the door
and I grabbed my baseball bat.

687
00:40:18,285 --> 00:40:20,809
- And then?

688
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:24,073
- I started swinging it
and yelling,

689
00:40:24,117 --> 00:40:26,511
smashing everything
in the room,

690
00:40:26,554 --> 00:40:28,600
and then I jumped
out the window.

691
00:40:28,643 --> 00:40:31,341
- Do you actually rememberthese events,

692
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,256
or did Darlene tell you this?

693
00:40:34,997 --> 00:40:36,085
- Darlene.

694
00:40:37,391 --> 00:40:40,525
- Is that similar to otherinstances in your life

695
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:42,657
when you've lost time?

696
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,358
- No, only when Mr. Robot
takes over.

697
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:52,014
- Do you think it's possible

698
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:55,278
Mr. Robot is the reasonwhy you can't remember?

699
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:01,067
- What's she talking about?

700
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:04,070
You didn't exist
when I was a kid.

701
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:05,419
Did you?

702
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:08,770
- That's not important.

703
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:11,164
What's important
is that I'm here now.

704
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:13,514
- Stop lying to me.
How long have you been here?

705
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:15,255
- Don't you see
what's happening?

706
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:18,127
She pushed us apart before.
She's doing it again.

707
00:41:18,171 --> 00:41:21,000
- Answer the question!
How long?

708
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:23,350
How long have you been
messing with my head?

709
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:25,091
- What do you want me to say?

710
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,745
I've been here
since the first day

711
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:28,181
that I was needed.

712
00:41:28,224 --> 00:41:31,401
I exist for a reason.
I always have.

713
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:34,100
It's always been my job
to protect him.

714
00:41:34,143 --> 00:41:37,146
You know this isn't the way.
This is dangerous.

715
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,759
You can't do this to him.
Please do not do this to him.

716
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:42,717
He's not supposed to know.

717
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,202
- Know what?

718
00:41:52,161 --> 00:41:54,294
- Elliot, do you believeMr. Robot when he says

719
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:55,861
he's here to protect you?

720
00:42:00,256 --> 00:42:01,693
- Yes.

721
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,697
- So if it's possiblethat it could have been

722
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,874
Mr. Robot that day,do you know why he might have

723
00:42:08,917 --> 00:42:11,964
picked up that batand jumped out that window?

724
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,662
- Why are we going through
all these details again?

725
00:42:14,706 --> 00:42:16,011
Get to the fucking point!

726
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:18,840
- That's it, bruh.
Find that poison.

727
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,888
- Do you think Mr. Robotwas protecting you

728
00:42:22,931 --> 00:42:24,759
from something in that moment?

729
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,201
- Like what?

730
00:42:34,203 --> 00:42:37,250
- You said you did this whenyour father came into the room.

731
00:42:42,864 --> 00:42:44,866
Elliot, look at me.

732
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:52,613
Why do you think you hadsuch a strong reaction

733
00:42:52,657 --> 00:42:55,355
when your fathercame into the room?

734
00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:08,716
I don't know.

735
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:12,720
I don't know.

736
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:15,854
I--I can't...

737
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,206
I can't remember.

738
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:24,863
- Elliot.

739
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:32,392
- Maybe...

740
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:36,788
I was scared.

741
00:43:39,399 --> 00:43:41,183
- What were you scared of?

742
00:43:42,576 --> 00:43:46,406
- Krista...you do this,

743
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:48,190
it will destroy him.

744
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:50,236
- Elliot,what were you scared of?

745
00:43:50,279 --> 00:43:52,325
- He already told you
that he can't--

746
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:53,631
- Remember.

747
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,460
- His father.

748
00:44:07,557 --> 00:44:10,648
That's it, right?
You were scared of your father.

749
00:44:12,737 --> 00:44:15,000
- No.

750
00:44:15,043 --> 00:44:17,872
Why would I be scared of him?

751
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:19,700
He was my friend.

752
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,756
- I can't protect you anymore.

753
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:46,640
- Why would I be scared
of my father?

754
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,732
- Do you recall a time...

755
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:56,911
Your father ever hurt you?

756
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,000
- Hurt me?

757
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:03,004
He would never hurt me.

758
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:06,965
I told you,
he was--he was my friend.

759
00:45:08,053 --> 00:45:10,446
He was my only friend.

760
00:45:14,015 --> 00:45:16,452
- Then what made you scared
that day?

761
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,108
- I wasn't.

762
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:23,024
- You told me you were scared.

763
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:28,464
- I, uh--

764
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:29,770
Is that what I said?

765
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:36,821
Um...I'm--I'm confused.

766
00:45:42,043 --> 00:45:44,611
- You and your sister
were in the room.

767
00:45:48,223 --> 00:45:50,704
You heardyour father's footsteps.

768
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:54,708
- No.

769
00:45:56,841 --> 00:45:59,974
- You think it's possibleyou hid Darlene in the closet

770
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,584
to keep her safe?

771
00:46:03,325 --> 00:46:04,805
- No.

772
00:46:07,068 --> 00:46:09,462
- Your dad walkedinto the room...

773
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,467
No.

774
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,903
No.

775
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,777
- You grabbed a batto defend yourself.

776
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,779
- No, no, no, no.

777
00:46:26,435 --> 00:46:28,873
- You yelled at himto get away.

778
00:46:28,916 --> 00:46:30,744
You swung the bat at him.

779
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:31,832
- No.

780
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:37,011
- And you escapedthe only way you knew how.

781
00:46:44,932 --> 00:46:47,892
- Why were you afraidof your father?

782
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:59,729
Were you afraid he was going
to ask you to do something...

783
00:46:59,773 --> 00:47:02,471
you didn't want to do?

784
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:21,534
Yes.

785
00:47:25,494 --> 00:47:28,497
- Do you rememberwhat he asked you to do?

786
00:47:42,990 --> 00:47:45,079
- Yes, I remember.

787
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:49,649
- Elliot.

788
00:47:52,608 --> 00:47:54,915
Did your father
sexually molest you?

789
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,622
- Yes.

790
00:49:07,466 --> 00:49:10,599
- Elliot, I'm so sorrythat happened to you.

791
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:19,260
- Elliot, hear me, bruh.

792
00:49:19,304 --> 00:49:21,741
I know it feels like
you're all alone right now,

793
00:49:21,784 --> 00:49:22,872
but you're not.

794
00:49:22,916 --> 00:49:26,137
I know this pain, your pain.

795
00:49:27,312 --> 00:49:30,054
It's okay to feel
whatever you're feeling,

796
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:32,317
and if you can hear me,

797
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,450
I want you to know you don't
gotta be scared no more.

798
00:49:37,061 --> 00:49:39,367
- Don't--don't touch me.

799
00:49:41,108 --> 00:49:42,631
Don't touch me.

800
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:55,949
- My brother--

801
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,733
- Stop.

802
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:59,605
Please stop.

803
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:02,173
- You know there's nothing
you can do to stop this.

804
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,654
- I don't know
how to live with this.

805
00:50:07,265 --> 00:50:08,570
I don't wanna live with this.

806
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:10,355
- Not an option you got.
- Yes!

807
00:50:10,398 --> 00:50:12,966
Yes, there is.There is.

808
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:16,796
There has to be,because I can't do this.

809
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:17,927
I can't.

810
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:19,190
- I know it hurts right now,

811
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:20,974
but you purging
all that poison.

812
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:23,150
Soon you can be your true self.

813
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:25,413
My true self?

814
00:50:27,328 --> 00:50:29,113
I don't know who that is.

815
00:50:30,505 --> 00:50:32,116
I don't know who that is!

816
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,856
- That's because
you're still holding in

817
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,424
all the anger and sadness.

818
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,340
- What do I do?

819
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:45,738
- Right there,
that's what you do.

820
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:47,522
You let it out.

821
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,091
- Amen.

822
00:50:53,441 --> 00:50:55,269
- Once you let it all go,

823
00:50:55,313 --> 00:50:57,576
then you can finally meet
the real you.

824
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:04,583
- This ain't a death.

825
00:51:04,626 --> 00:51:06,846
- Elliot, you've been reborn.

826
00:51:10,545 --> 00:51:11,720
Why?

827
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,681
Why?

828
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:17,857
Why--why--why--whywould he do--

829
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,076
- There is no why.

830
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:23,558
You weren't the one in control.

831
00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:27,649
- I know it's hard to go on

832
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:31,131
when you're carrying this
around, but you can.

833
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,569
How?

834
00:51:35,962 --> 00:51:37,659
- You don't carry it alone.

835
00:51:39,879 --> 00:51:41,794
I'm here with you, bruh.

836
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:47,800
- You.

837
00:51:50,368 --> 00:51:52,370
You did this.

838
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:54,850
You did this to me.

839
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,463
- I did it for you.
- No.

840
00:51:58,506 --> 00:52:00,160
No, I don't believe you!

841
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,511

00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:19,580
- I know.
You weren't expecting me.

80
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:22,670
But I'm here for Elliot,
same as you.

81
00:05:22,713 --> 00:05:25,803
What can you expect
after what happened?

82
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:27,849
Life throws you
an error code like that,

83
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:31,418
you don't have the luxury of
a fucking pop-up explanation.

84
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,420
So what are you
supposed to do?

85
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,247
Move on without answers,

86
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,729
or stay down and drive
yourself crazy with questions?

87
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:42,472
That's where Elliot is--
mired in conflict.

88
00:05:42,516 --> 00:05:44,082
And that's why I'm here.

89
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:46,868
How we doing?

90
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:49,871
- Got line of sight on the IMSI
catcher to the front door.

91
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,003
Deus members
should be arriving soon.

92
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:55,224
Where the fuck have you been?

93
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,922
- Got held up.

94
00:05:57,966 --> 00:06:00,098
- What kind of answer is that?

95
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,578
You had me worried.

96
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:03,624
I told you the Dark Army
is looking for you.

97
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,234
- The day didn't go
exactly as planned.

98
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:08,933
Cut me some slack, okay?
Things went a little sideways.

99
00:06:08,977 --> 00:06:12,067
- Oh. Really?
Is that so?

100
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:15,070
Things went a little sideways
for you, huh?

101
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:16,811
You want to hear about
the fucking night I've had?

102
00:06:16,854 --> 00:06:19,466
- This isn't a pissing contest,
sweetheart.

103
00:06:24,906 --> 00:06:26,995
Let's just get back to work.

104
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,482
What the fuck are you doing?

105
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:40,617
- Why are you here?

106
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:43,011
Where is he?

107
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,625
You don't want him
here right now.

108
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:50,801
- Why the fuck not?

109
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,674
- He just can't.
Not now.

110
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:57,591
- What happened to him?

111
00:07:00,724 --> 00:07:03,597
- He'll be fine.
He just needs some time.

112
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,818
- I don't trust you.

113
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:09,211
- I don't need you to trust me.

114
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,082
I just need you
to help me pull this off.

115
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:13,258
- Tell me what's going on,
or I'm walking.

116
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:15,739
- I can't.

117
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:18,699
He needs to be
the one to tell you...

118
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:21,092
when he's ready.

119
00:07:37,065 --> 00:07:38,327
What the fuck
are you doing here?

120
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,676
Do you realize
how risky this is?

121
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,026
What if someone saw you?

122
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,288
She's with me.

123
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:44,855
Out with it.
Why are you here?

124
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:45,987
You're supposed to be
across the street

125
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,249
with your Deus pals.

126
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:49,294
- There's one last thing
I need from you.

127
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,732
- Well, it's a little late in
the game to be making demands.

128
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:53,124
- It's--

129
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,866
it's not a demand.

130
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,955
It's a favor.

131
00:07:57,999 --> 00:08:01,002
- Given the danger you've put
us all in just by being here,

132
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,743
I hope it's worth it.

133
00:08:02,786 --> 00:08:04,745
- It is.

134
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,795
- What's this?

135
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:18,715
- I want you to destroy
Whiterose's machine.

136
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,153
Everything you need to know
about her project,

137
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:24,199
it's on here.

138
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,334
Promise me.

139
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,641
- After tonight,
she'll be ruined.

140
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,904
Why is this important to you?

141
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:41,085
- Because it was
important to Angela.

142
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,305
It's what she wanted.

143
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:48,397
- Okay.

144
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,617
I promise.

145
00:08:58,146 --> 00:09:00,278
Remember,
you gotta keep everyone there

146
00:09:00,322 --> 00:09:02,063
until we grab
their phone numbers.

147
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:04,805
Don't let anyone leave,
especially Whiterose.

148
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,423
- What was that about?

149
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,820
Hey.

150
00:09:19,863 --> 00:09:24,215
What the hell does
Price know about Angela?

151
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,695
What is going on?

152
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,958
- I'll fill you in,
but right now,

153
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,091
we gotta get started.

154
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:33,137
We're already behind.

155
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,139
In order to rob
the Deus Group blind,

156
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:36,880
we need to get access
to transfer funds

157
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:38,969
from Cyprus National Bank.

158
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:42,407
To do that, we need every
Deus asshole's phone number.

159
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:44,496
Why?
Because Darlene can then match

160
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,977
each of those phone numbers
to its corresponding Cyprus

161
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:50,807
National Bank account number
and initiate a transfer.

162
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,287
Once she initiates
the transfer,

163
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,158
it'll trigger
a security 2FA code

164
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:56,944
that'll be texted to every
Deus dickhead's phone.

165
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,380
Then Darlene will run a script

166
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:00,338
to automatically grab
those 2FA codes,

167
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,992
and transfer all their money

168
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,995
before they have time
to stop it.

169
00:10:09,304 --> 00:10:12,742
So, yeah, I'm worried.

170
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:15,832
For what, though,
I'm not sure.

171
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:17,399
But whatever it is...

172
00:10:20,576 --> 00:10:22,709
It's coming.

173
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:33,894
- I can't believe Angela never
told me Price was her father.

174
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:40,944
- Maybe she didn't know.

175
00:10:45,514 --> 00:10:47,516
- I miss her.

176
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,305
Darlene, I--

177
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:55,742
- No, I don't want
to talk about it.

178
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:58,266
I just...

179
00:10:58,309 --> 00:11:00,355
I just wanted to say that.

180
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,928
- Okay.

181
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,377
Something's not right.

182
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,249
No one's gone in or out
of that building

183
00:11:25,293 --> 00:11:27,251
other than Price.

184
00:11:32,169 --> 00:11:35,085
- Wait,
you think they're onto us?

185
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,391
- I don't know.

186
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:50,144
- I see I'm the first
to arrive.

187
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,494
- Technically, I was first.

188
00:12:07,944 --> 00:12:09,903
- You want to tell me
what's going on?

189
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,211
- I thought we'd start
with a drink.

190
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,868
- I'm an old man, Zhang.

191
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:22,132
I gave up on foreplay long ago.

192
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,481
Let's just skip
ahead to the part

193
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:25,919
where you try to fuck me.

194
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,968
- If they are onto us,

195
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:33,361
if the Deus Group
doesn't show,

196
00:12:33,404 --> 00:12:34,536
everything's we've been
working on

197
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:37,104
will be a big fucking fail.

198
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:40,498
If Elliot were here,
what would he do?

199
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:44,111
He'd look for abnormalities,
incompatibilities,

200
00:12:44,154 --> 00:12:47,462
anything that isn't adding up,
any conflicts.

201
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,680
- What are you doing?

202
00:12:48,724 --> 00:12:49,986
- Looking.

203
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,554
- For?
- I don't know yet.

204
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:54,686
Elliot saved an image
of Tyrell's phone,

205
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:56,166
swiped all his credentials.

206
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,515
If Whiterose thought
something was up,

207
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,256
she would've told
the other members,

208
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,868
including the guy
she was having the meeting for.

209
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:08,526
- All you had to do
was nothing,

210
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,269
just sit idly by and wait
for the new year to arrive,

211
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:16,317
but you couldn't leave
well enough alone.

212
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:22,062
I wanted to let you live
into retirement--

213
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:23,890
I planned on it--

214
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,371
as a gift of sorts.

215
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:29,199
I guess you can say
I always get

216
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,899
swept up when it comes
to the holidays.

217
00:13:32,942 --> 00:13:34,901
But then you had to be naughty.

218
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:37,077
- Come on, Zhang.

219
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,558
You know I've never been
the nice type.

220
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:44,214
- Let me drive.

221
00:13:44,258 --> 00:13:46,086
Maybe his calendar.

222
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,048
- After your
abrupt resignation

223
00:13:52,092 --> 00:13:54,442
and Mr. Alderson's
curious disappearance,

224
00:13:54,485 --> 00:13:56,270
it wasn't hard to figure out
that you two

225
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,575
were working together.

226
00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:00,143
Tell me Mr. Alderson's plan,

227
00:14:00,187 --> 00:14:01,753
and these gentlemen
will take you home

228
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:04,191
and inject you with maitotoxin.

229
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:06,584
You will die in your sleep.

230
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:09,587
The papers will say
you passed from heart failure.

231
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:13,243
Sad, but painless.

232
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:16,420
Or, we could go the other way.

233
00:14:16,464 --> 00:14:18,422
You're well aware
of our methods.

234
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,655
- So you canceled
the Deus Group meeting

235
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:38,399
based on this half-cocked
conspiracy theory of yours.

236
00:14:40,314 --> 00:14:44,448
This last-minute change will
not sit well with the others.

237
00:14:44,492 --> 00:14:46,711
- Downtown near Wall Street.

238
00:14:49,671 --> 00:14:51,673
Hey, are you hearing this?

239
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:52,804
Let's move.
We gotta go.

240
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:54,154
Do-or-die time.

241
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:55,590
They're probably
already inside,

242
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,157
which means
we'll have to find a way in

243
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,290
to get a line of sight.

244
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,727
- Price didn't know
about the venue change.

245
00:15:02,771 --> 00:15:05,121
- So what?

246
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:06,383
- Why didn't they tell him?

247
00:15:06,427 --> 00:15:07,776
- I don't know.

248
00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:10,213
He's persona non grata
on his way out.

249
00:15:10,257 --> 00:15:11,998
Who gives a shit?

250
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,390
- Why the heavy
security detail?

251
00:15:13,434 --> 00:15:14,652
Price is one guy.

252
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:16,480
If they wanted
to get rid of him,

253
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:20,136
they don't need a team
of Dark Army soldiers to do it.

254
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:30,320
They're not there
to kill Price.

255
00:15:30,364 --> 00:15:32,670
They're there
to protect someone.

256
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:36,196
- The meeting is taking place
as we speak.

257
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,548
I'm sure Mr. Wellick,
the new CEO of E Corp,

258
00:15:40,591 --> 00:15:44,073
is impressing everyone
with his smile.

259
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:45,770
Unfortunately,
I'll be uncharacteristically

260
00:15:45,814 --> 00:15:47,207
late for the gathering,

261
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,122
but I'm sure
they'll understand.

262
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:52,168
- Will they?
Hmm.

263
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:54,518
I'd expect mutiny

264
00:15:54,562 --> 00:15:56,694
when they realize
that Tyrell Wellick,

265
00:15:56,738 --> 00:15:58,653
your guest of honor

266
00:15:58,696 --> 00:16:01,786
and the sole purpose
for the meeting,

267
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,052
will not be in attendance.

268
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,494
- I'm gonna stay.

269
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,235
- What?

270
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:17,063
- You have the exploit
to verify the phone numbers

271
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:20,109
ready to go.

272
00:16:20,153 --> 00:16:21,589
- No, we can't split up.

273
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:23,591
What if something else
goes wrong with the plan?

274
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:30,467
- You know,
it just occurred to me.

275
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:33,209
We've never gotten
drunk together, have we?

276
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:39,389
I think this might
be a good night to start.

277
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,525
What do you think?

278
00:16:44,568 --> 00:16:47,919
- The plan is pointless
if we don't get Whiterose, too.

279
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,747
She's gotta be in there.
I have to stay.

280
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,228
- That makes no sense.
We only have one IMSI capture.

281
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:55,144
We need to do this together.
- We don't have a choice.

282
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,277
Now go.

283
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:02,282
- Mr. Wellick
is nowhere to be found.

284
00:17:02,325 --> 00:17:03,761
We're still searching
the tri-state area--

285
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:05,372
- A waste of time.
Stop.

286
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:08,375
Tell them all to stop.

287
00:17:08,418 --> 00:17:11,334
Is this part of your plan?

288
00:17:11,378 --> 00:17:13,684
Mr. Wellick's
mysterious disappearance?

289
00:17:13,728 --> 00:17:15,947
What did you do to him?

290
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,514
- Truthfully...

291
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:20,256
I have no idea
where Wellick is.

292
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,258
He may be dead.

293
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,564
Mm.

294
00:17:23,607 --> 00:17:25,827
No, no, no.
Now I think of it,

295
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:28,482
he did mention
something about

296
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,441
wanting to travel
the great southwest

297
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:35,619
in a '65 El Camino convertible,

298
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:38,187
wind in his hair...

299
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:15,703
- He's beaten you!

300
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:19,533
You lost today.

301
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,230
Doesn't mean
we can't fight back tomorrow,

302
00:18:21,274 --> 00:18:22,840
but right now,
we have to leave

303
00:18:22,884 --> 00:18:25,800
and warn the Deus Group
before this gets worse.

304
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,324
- We are not going anywhere.

305
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,852
- If you won't
listen to reason,

306
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,724
then I'm done.

307
00:18:39,074 --> 00:18:40,728
- Whoa.

308
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,306
It's bad management

309
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,265
when your best employees
either walk off the job,

310
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:58,963
or blow their brains out.

311
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,813
- Fuck am I gonna
get in there?

312
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,747
- Perimeter is secure.

313
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,532
Make sure
these doors stay locked

314
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:46,968
the rest of the evening.

315
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:50,885
- Goddamn. Christmas Day?
This better be good.

316
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:52,800
- Yeah, he's a dickwad,
but a total and complete

317
00:19:52,843 --> 00:19:54,584
shutdown of Muslims
entering the United States...

318
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:57,935
- That runaround for
tonight's location details...

319
00:19:57,979 --> 00:19:59,720
- Iraq's a proper mess.

320
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,069
Deus needs to get
its giant dick

321
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,897
out of that sand
sooner than later.

322
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,507
- Rousseff is fucked.

323
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:08,032
He did it to himself.
Or was that us?

324
00:20:08,076 --> 00:20:09,773
- How are you, my friend?

325
00:20:09,817 --> 00:20:12,950
- Just came off an 11-hour
flight on Christmas Day.

326
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:15,388
- Ah.
- My wife is furious.

327
00:20:15,431 --> 00:20:17,477
And my girlfriend?

328
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,088
She won't return
my phone calls.

329
00:20:20,131 --> 00:20:22,830
Whatever Zhang
has planned better be good.

330
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:24,484
- Couldn't agree more.

331
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:28,096
- Evening, gentlemen.
Hors d'oeuvres?

332
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:31,099
- Speaking of,
where is our host?

333
00:21:16,231 --> 00:21:17,537
- Back inside.

334
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,887
This entrance
is off limits tonight.

335
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,760
Go.

336
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,601
- There's no fucking way.

337
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,971
- Well?
Who is it?

338
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:54,198
Hello?

339
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,810
- That sure as hell
doesn't sound like Price.

340
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:59,116
- Mr. Alderson.

341
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,075
It's good to hear your voice.

342
00:23:01,118 --> 00:23:04,644
I was hoping
we could talk in person.

343
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:07,647
- You once told me that we'd
never see each other again.

344
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,605
What makes you
want to see me now?

345
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,826
- Call it a change of mind.

346
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,305
A realization.

347
00:23:16,525 --> 00:23:18,222
- Nah.

348
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:20,964
If I'm hearing your voice
on the other end of this call,

349
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:23,489
I'm good.

350
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,492
- And what does that mean?

351
00:23:26,535 --> 00:23:27,928
- You'll know soon enough.

352
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:32,585
- A proposal.

353
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,630
You stop whatever it is
you're planning,

354
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:36,545
and I give you information
that will prove to be

355
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,504
very valuable to you.

356
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:40,288
- You think
I'm gonna trust you?

357
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:43,160
- Let me earn your trust
by sharing first.

358
00:23:43,204 --> 00:23:45,815
It is about your friend...

359
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,513
Angela.

360
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:54,694
- What about her?
- You see, Elliot...

361
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:59,176
You think Angela's dead,

362
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,830
but she's not.

363
00:24:07,707 --> 00:24:09,839
- You sent me a picture
of her dead body,

364
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,624
you sick fucking fuck.

365
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:15,192
- And you believe
what most people believe?

366
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:19,109
Only what is right
in front of you?

367
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,198
I expected more from you.

368
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,897
- You think I'm gonna believe
this bullshit?

369
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,726
You killed her.
Angela's dead.

370
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,989
- No, Elliot.

371
00:24:29,032 --> 00:24:31,165
Angela's alive.

372
00:24:33,167 --> 00:24:35,125
And if you allow me,

373
00:24:35,169 --> 00:24:37,998
I can take you to her.

374
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,696
Would you like that, Elliot?

375
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:43,569
Would you like
to see Angela again?

376
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,659
To hear her voice?

377
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:49,270
To hold her hand?

378
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:01,935
Elliot, are you there?

379
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:15,862
- Yes.

380
00:25:18,691 --> 00:25:21,998
- I know you have regrets,
Elliot,

381
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:24,435
and pain.

382
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,133
I know there are things
in your life

383
00:25:26,176 --> 00:25:28,744
you wish were different,
just the same as Angela,

384
00:25:28,788 --> 00:25:33,096
and I can show you a way that
you can make it all go away,

385
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,620
just as I did for her.

386
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:36,099
You can reset everything

387
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:38,145
and live in the world
you deserve,

388
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:41,191
a world without
all the pain you're carrying,

389
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:44,891
without your past,
without your regrets.

390
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,936
Please, Elliot.

391
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,156
Let me show you the world

392
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:52,159
that I showed
your closest friend.

393
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,823
- I saw what you did to her

394
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,912
before you killed her.

395
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:11,308
That wasn't Angela.
You used her.

396
00:26:11,352 --> 00:26:14,094
You turned her
into someone else.

397
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:17,445
- Then don't take
my word for it.

398
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:20,361
Ask her yourself.

399
00:26:23,016 --> 00:26:24,974
Elliot,

400
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:28,325
we don't have to fight
like this anymore.

401
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,241
Let's finally make peace
with each other,

402
00:26:31,285 --> 00:26:34,680
as we were always meant to do.

403
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:39,902
Let go of the anger
and the hatred

404
00:26:39,946 --> 00:26:41,991
you've built up towards me.

405
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:45,429
Understand I've only
wished to help.

406
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:48,476
- Here's the thing.

407
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,741
I don't need help right now.

408
00:26:52,785 --> 00:26:54,743
You do.

409
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:09,062
- Good evening,
people of Earth.

410
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,020
We are fsociety.

411
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:12,892
We have risen from the ashes

412
00:27:12,935 --> 00:27:15,721
to bring you
a Christmas miracle,

413
00:27:15,764 --> 00:27:20,247
a miracle that will finally
reveal our true nemesis.

414
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:24,207
The secret club running
the world is the Deus Group,

415
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,079
a clandestine collection

416
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:28,951
of the world's richest
and most powerful people.

417
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:32,955
Deus Group, we know you,
and we know what you do.

418
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:36,306
And tonight, the whole world
will learn about you.

419
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,917
Most of you watching
have never heard

420
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,919
the name Deus Group.

421
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:42,486
That's because they've worked
hard to keep it that way.

422
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,141
To begin to understand
their reach,

423
00:27:45,185 --> 00:27:48,797
to see the evil crimes
they're responsible for,

424
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,233
click on the link below

425
00:27:50,277 --> 00:27:52,192
to download
all their private files.

426
00:27:52,235 --> 00:27:55,151
And if you'd like to meet
the despicable individuals

427
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:57,284
who have co-opted your lives
for profit,

428
00:27:57,327 --> 00:27:59,895
come meet them now in person

429
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:03,594
while they wine and dine
at Cipriani.

430
00:28:03,638 --> 00:28:08,208
I am sure
they'd appreciate the visit.

431
00:28:08,251 --> 00:28:10,514
Deus Group,
you have been owned.

432
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:13,430
fsociety and the world
will cheer

433
00:28:13,474 --> 00:28:16,607
as we watch your black hearts
stop beating.

434
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,305
This is not a warning.

435
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:20,437
This is the beginning
of the end.

436
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:22,831
We are fsociety.

437
00:28:36,845 --> 00:28:38,107
- Hey.

438
00:28:38,151 --> 00:28:39,369
- Did you see the video?

439
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:40,936
- Yeah.

440
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,024
- Hopefully,
that'll do the trick

441
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,026
to smoke these fuckers out.

442
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,898
Did you find Whiterose?

443
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:48,291
- Yeah.
I talked to her.

444
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,946
- You what?
Jesus Christ.

445
00:28:50,990 --> 00:28:52,165
You were supposed
to hack her phone,

446
00:28:52,208 --> 00:28:54,515
not call it.

447
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,517
- It was only for a second.

448
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,214
But it was Price's phone,

449
00:28:58,258 --> 00:29:01,000
so we still need
to get Whiterose's number.

450
00:29:04,351 --> 00:29:06,135
- Are you okay?

451
00:29:09,182 --> 00:29:12,620
- I don't know.

452
00:29:12,663 --> 00:29:15,144
I don't know anymore.

453
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,198
- Hey, Elliot?

454
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,033
I'm glad you're back.

455
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:50,484
- I gotta go.

456
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,702
- What happened?

457
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,182
- There's a cell tower.

458
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:54,357
If I can see traffic
on that tower--

459
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:56,185
- No, I mean--

460
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:59,406
- We can't get past her
security and into the hotel.

461
00:29:59,449 --> 00:30:01,103
We need her phone number.

462
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:02,670
- Hey.

463
00:30:02,713 --> 00:30:04,541
Are you gonna be okay?

464
00:30:04,585 --> 00:30:05,716
- Only way this works
is if we hit their accounts

465
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,414
at the same time.

466
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:08,937
If the other members
get the 2FA codes first,

467
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:10,417
they'll alert Whiterose.

468
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,635
Just keep them
in your line of sight.

469
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,943
I'll let you know
when I've got it.

470
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:27,434
- Sergey,
you have to trust me.

471
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:30,741
We will get through this.
Everything will be all right.

472
00:30:30,785 --> 00:30:33,222
Oh, don't listen
to that Mason.

473
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:35,572
The man is an absolute buffoon.

474
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:38,706
No, no, don't leave.
Don't go outside.

475
00:30:38,749 --> 00:30:41,927
Tell everyone to remain,
Sergey.

476
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,501
Sergey?

477
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:52,981
Hello?

478
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,678
Hello?

479
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,425
So that's it.

480
00:31:02,469 --> 00:31:04,079
So that's your big move!

481
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:06,125
You think that I can't survive
being doxxed?

482
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:08,344
- I have no idea.

483
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:11,652
I'm as curious as you.

484
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,286
- Hello?

485
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:45,180
- Come on!

486
00:32:50,403 --> 00:32:52,144
- I can't do anything about it.
Look. It's not working.

487
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:54,450
Obviously, it's not working.

488
00:34:20,406 --> 00:34:22,190
Shit.
- Private event tonight.

489
00:34:22,234 --> 00:34:24,845
You can't be here.
Everyone, back it up.

490
00:34:50,566 --> 00:34:52,177
- A short time ago,
fsociety resurfaced

491
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,440
with a new video,
and while the contents

492
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,746
of that video remain
largely unconfirmed,

493
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:58,270
it focuses entirely

494
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,228
on an international
investment firm,

495
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:01,882
the Deus Group.

496
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:23,556
It's a collection of powerful
men whom fsociety claims

497
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,688
to be guilty
of international crimes,

498
00:35:25,732 --> 00:35:28,648
and as you can see behind me,
onlookers have gathered

499
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:29,823
with hopes
of catching a glimpse

500
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,390
of any Deus Group members.

501
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,537
- Just got into
the cell tower.

502
00:36:25,618 --> 00:36:28,360
- All this over a little
pipsqueak in a hoodie.

503
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,417
- Where are we at, kiddo?

504
00:36:42,461 --> 00:36:43,723
- I've got a bunch of numbers.

505
00:36:43,766 --> 00:36:45,899
I just can't tell
if any of them are hers.

506
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:48,902
- Truth be told,
I never liked Mr. Alderson--

507
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:53,428
his anxious demeanor,
his juvenile anger.

508
00:36:53,472 --> 00:36:55,300
But...

509
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:58,868
he does bring
something to the table--

510
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,567
well, for me.

511
00:37:22,457 --> 00:37:25,460
- Mr. Alderson
is the only person I believe

512
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:30,596
actually able to hurt you...

513
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:57,710
Truly hurt you.

514
00:38:00,408 --> 00:38:03,106
And clearly,

515
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,457
you believe it, too.

516
00:38:20,472 --> 00:38:22,561
- Come on.

517
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:30,133
- Why do we have to cut these
things so goddamn close?

518
00:38:53,069 --> 00:38:55,681
- What are you doing?

519
00:38:57,683 --> 00:38:59,685
- Peaceful out here.

520
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:03,776
Cold winter air.

521
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,792
- Are you really going to make
me force you into the car?

522
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:31,630
- You know, I almost
let myself believe you...

523
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:37,070
When you said Angela
was still alive.

524
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:38,941
I know what kind of conman
you are,

525
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:41,509
how you operate.

526
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,598
Even though I saw your men

527
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:46,775
drag her dead body away,

528
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:49,735
I still wanted to believe
what you were saying.

529
00:40:09,537 --> 00:40:11,539
When you spoke
to Mr. Alderson,

530
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:15,891
I felt the power
of your promise.

531
00:40:24,204 --> 00:40:26,119
And all I could think is,
well...

532
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:30,210
maybe that's what my daughter
thought when you came to her.

533
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:41,221
The desperation to have
all her pain go away,

534
00:40:41,264 --> 00:40:43,745
to have her past rewritten--

535
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:46,008
and that's why it works, right?

536
00:40:56,149 --> 00:40:59,021
The one thing
every person has:

537
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,197
regret.

538
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,286
You weaponize that,

539
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,594
and then you use that weapon
against them

540
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,161
to destroy them.

541
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:10,598
But here's the thing
I've realized as of late.

542
00:41:10,642 --> 00:41:12,382
With Angela--

543
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,080
didn't work.

544
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,130
Angela lives on

545
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:25,091
in the lives
of the people who love her.

546
00:41:25,134 --> 00:41:26,701
And that love...

547
00:41:26,745 --> 00:41:31,663
that love fuels
their unwavering resolve

548
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:35,057
to turn the tables
to destroy you.

549
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:52,901
You just remember, Zhang.

550
00:41:52,945 --> 00:41:55,948
You did all this to yourself.

551
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:03,433
- You should take
your own advice, Phillip.

552
00:42:03,477 --> 00:42:05,958
Accept your truth.

553
00:42:08,264 --> 00:42:10,876
It's over.

554
00:42:13,008 --> 00:42:15,968
- Yeah.

555
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:18,448
Yes.

556
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:21,451
I suppose it is.

557
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,856
- It happened.

558
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,125
It actually happened.

559
00:42:45,345 --> 00:42:47,260
- What?

560
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:50,698
- Something wrong, old sport?

561
00:42:53,875 --> 00:42:55,703
- What is this?

562
00:42:55,747 --> 00:42:58,967
- Well,
if it's what I think it is,

563
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:01,970
we're all broke.

564
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:04,233
- No.

565
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:07,280
That's impossible.

566
00:43:07,323 --> 00:43:09,456
- Apparently not.

567
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:16,332
- Where is it, Phillip?

568
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:18,770
Where is my fucking money?

569
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:27,039
- Gone.

570
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,870
-  No.
- I warned you.

571
00:43:31,913 --> 00:43:35,003
I told you long ago.
I'm a mercenary.

572
00:43:35,047 --> 00:43:38,267
I'd rather see you lose
than win myself.

573
00:43:38,311 --> 00:43:40,052
- That can't be.
- Finally.

574
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:44,186
I found a way to take
what's most important to you.

575
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,319
- No, no.

576
00:43:46,362 --> 00:43:49,496
- Your project,

577
00:43:49,539 --> 00:43:52,020
your dream

578
00:43:52,064 --> 00:43:55,110
of another world--

579
00:43:55,154 --> 00:43:57,722
it's as good as dead.

580
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:07,819
Think of it this way, Zhang.

581
00:44:07,862 --> 00:44:11,866
You didn't lose the game.

582
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,739
You just ran out of time.

583
00:44:42,288 --> 00:44:46,248
- And like that...

584
00:44:46,292 --> 00:44:49,295
Rome falls.

585
00:44:49,338 --> 00:44:52,124
No more Deus Group.

586
00:44:52,167 --> 00:44:56,128
No more top 1% of the top 1%.

587
00:44:57,651 --> 00:45:01,046
No more controlling
every piece of our lives.

588
00:45:06,834 --> 00:45:11,273
No more playing God
without permission.

589
00:45:11,317 --> 00:45:13,101
We took them down.

590
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:15,974
All of them.

591
00:45:49,921 --> 00:45:51,487
- FBI.
Open the door.

592
00:45:53,402 --> 00:45:55,448
We have a warrant.

593
00:45:58,146 --> 00:46:00,670
Minister Zhang,
we have a warrant.

594
00:46:02,194 --> 00:46:04,152
FBI.

595
00:46:05,197 --> 00:46:07,199
Open the door.

596
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:12,508
Minister Zhang, come out.

597
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:15,207
We have a warrant
for your arrest.

598
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,215
Minister Zhang.

599
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:29,482
Minister Zhang,
we're coming in.

600
00:46:29,525 --> 00:46:33,225
Three, two, one,
execute, execute, execute.

‐ In this day and age,

00:00:15,883 --> 00:00:17,985
it's sicker not
having panic attacks.

Fuck!

a normal couple

00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,799
- Usually I hand pick someone
to do the introductions,

131
00:16:57,842 --> 00:17:01,150
but I felt that unnecessary
since we've already met.

132
00:17:05,502 --> 00:17:07,113
Please, have a seat.

133
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,249
- This isn't gonna work on me.

134
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:17,079
- What are you referring to?

135
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:23,259
- The computer I used
growing up.

136
00:17:23,303 --> 00:17:26,088
A book my dad used to read.

137
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,177
You even got
Qwerty here somehow.

138
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,094
It may have worked on Angela,

139
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,357
but your brainwashing
isn't gonna work on me.

140
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:41,190
- This procedure has never
been about brainwashing.

141
00:17:41,234 --> 00:17:45,325
It is about helping you come
to an understanding.

142
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:54,595
- What's in the box?

143
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:58,294
- I had a lot of pain
growing up.

144
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:01,776
I wasn't born
who I was meant to be,

145
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:05,127
and it cost me a lot.

146
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:08,174
It cost me my one true love.

147
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:13,744
It cost me the life I was owed,
the world I deserved.

148
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:16,138
- You're not answering
my question.

149
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,271
- This world around us,
I'm tired of it.

150
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,708
I'm tired of the pain
it causes.

151
00:18:20,751 --> 00:18:23,189
I'm tired of
the disappointment it is,

152
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,408
and all I've been trying to do,
Elliot,

153
00:18:25,452 --> 00:18:28,803
all I ever wanted was
to finally bring

154
00:18:28,846 --> 00:18:30,718
an end to that dysfunction

155
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:34,417
and deliver us a better world.

156
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:46,647
- You don't want
to help the world.

157
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,257
You want to destroy it.

158
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:53,828
You want to destroy it
because you hate people

159
00:18:53,871 --> 00:18:57,397
for what they've done to you,

160
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,487
and you can't look past that
to actually see the good in it.

161
00:19:09,452 --> 00:19:12,499
Elliot, please.

162
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,460
Don't make me laugh.

163
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:22,465
You think I'm the one that
wants to destroy the world?

164
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,468
I'm the one that hates people?

165
00:19:25,512 --> 00:19:27,949
That can't see the good in it?

166
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:30,691
Look around you.

167
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,475
Everywhere we turn,

168
00:19:32,519 --> 00:19:37,393
all we see is spite from our
so-called fellow man.

169
00:19:37,437 --> 00:19:39,439
Every day we turn on the news,

170
00:19:39,482 --> 00:19:41,571
we're constantly told
by our leaders,

171
00:19:41,615 --> 00:19:43,834
our scientists,
our religions

172
00:19:43,878 --> 00:19:48,274
that our world is crumbling,
and that we are the problem.

173
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:51,712
We are the root of everything
that is wrong,

174
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,236
that we don't stand a chance.

175
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,021
We are told this so much
that self-hatred

176
00:19:57,065 --> 00:20:00,590
is no longer considered
an anomaly but a given,

177
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:04,246
and yet you dare point
the finger at me

178
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,901
when I try to bring order
to its chaos?

179
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:12,254
When I have sacrificed
everything to make it better?

180
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,349
Please!

181
00:20:20,393 --> 00:20:23,744
Don't make me laugh.

182
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,669
On the contrary,

183
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:40,064
it is my love for people
that drives me.

184
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:43,720
It always has been,
because I know,

185
00:20:43,764 --> 00:20:48,595
deep in every person's heart...

186
00:20:48,638 --> 00:20:51,467
They are trying to be good.

187
00:20:51,511 --> 00:20:58,300
They were just dealt a bad hand
by a world unfit for us

188
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:03,436
so please don't make me
fucking laugh

189
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:07,614
and accuse me of hating people
when you, Elliot,

190
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:10,834
wear that hate like
a badge of honor!

191
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:14,882
Shall I remind you
of your group's name?

192
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:25,806
Admit it.

193
00:21:25,849 --> 00:21:29,549
Hatred has been your anthem,

194
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:32,813
not mine.

195
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:41,952
- You're right.

196
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:46,740
I hate people.

197
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:49,656
I'm scared of them.

198
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:53,486
I've been scared of them
practically my whole life.

199
00:21:55,836 --> 00:22:00,101
People I loved--
people I trusted--

200
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,365
have done their
absolute worst to me.

201
00:22:07,456 --> 00:22:10,807
And for a long time,
that's all I ever knew.

202
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:17,814
So, yeah,
I called my group fsociety,

203
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:21,992
because you know what?
Fuck society.

204
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:27,476
Society deserves to be hated
for everything

205
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,479
you said they did and more.

206
00:22:32,612 --> 00:22:34,483
Fuck every last one of them

207
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:37,660
for what we've
all been through.

208
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:50,891
But then there
are some people out there...

209
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,636
And it doesn't happen a lot.

210
00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,118
It's rare.

211
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:04,121
But they refuse
to let you hate them.

212
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:11,520
In fact, they care about you
in spite of it.

213
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:15,089
And the really special ones,

214
00:23:15,132 --> 00:23:19,528
they're relentless at it.

215
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,574
Doesn't matter
what you do to them.

216
00:23:21,617 --> 00:23:25,839
They take it
and care about you anyway.

217
00:23:27,797 --> 00:23:30,060
They don't abandon you,

218
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:33,586
no matter how many reasons
you give them.

219
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:38,547
No matter how much you're

220
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:42,072
practically begging them
to leave.

221
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,124
And you wanna know why?

222
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:58,567
Because they feel something
for me that I can't.

223
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,805
They love me.

224
00:24:29,598 --> 00:24:33,776
And for all the pain
I've been through,

225
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,693
that heals me.

226
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:40,304
Maybe not instantly.

227
00:24:40,348 --> 00:24:42,611
Maybe not even for a long time,

228
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:46,833
but it heals.

229
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:49,966
And, yeah, there are setbacks.

230
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:54,667
We do fucked up things
to each other.

231
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,758
And we hurt each other,
and it gets messy,

232
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:01,978
but that's just us,

233
00:25:02,022 --> 00:25:05,982
in any world you're in.

234
00:25:06,026 --> 00:25:09,246
And, yeah, you're right.

235
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:14,164
We're all told
we don't stand a chance,

236
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:18,168
and yet we stand.

237
00:25:18,212 --> 00:25:24,000
We break,
but we keep going,

238
00:25:24,044 --> 00:25:28,657
and that is not a flaw.

239
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:32,574
That's what makes us.

240
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:36,883
So, no, I will not give up
on this world.

241
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:41,191
And if you can't see why,

242
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:45,021
then I speak
for everyone when I say,

243
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:46,936
fuck you!

244
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,208
- Pity.

245
00:25:58,252 --> 00:26:00,646
I thought we shared a vision.

246
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:02,169
- What is that?

247
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,214
- It appears the plant
is losing power

248
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,042
to the cooling system.
- Why?

249
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:07,696
- As you can imagine,

250
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,046
my machine requires
a significant amount of water,

251
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:12,745
so it has to draw all
the plant's power,

252
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,660
including its
backup generators.

253
00:26:14,703 --> 00:26:16,096
- You turned it on?

254
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:17,967
- Of course I have.

255
00:26:18,011 --> 00:26:21,231
We're on a very tight schedule.
- Your machine.

256
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:23,886
It won't work.
I installed malware.

257
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,758
- Yes, we discovered
your breach.

258
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,281
How do you think we found you?

259
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:29,631
- Then you know
it already executed.

260
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:32,068
- Except for the fact that
my machine was already running

261
00:26:32,112 --> 00:26:34,331
by the time you installed
your little exploit.

262
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,898
- No, you don't understand.

263
00:26:35,942 --> 00:26:39,641
- Earlier you accused me
of being a murderer,

264
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:43,863
but soon you will see all those
lives that have been lost

265
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:45,038
so that we could get
to this point

266
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:46,256
will not be in vain.

267
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,215
In fact,
they won't be lost at all.

268
00:26:48,258 --> 00:26:51,740
They will all be found again
as soon as this world around us

269
00:26:51,784 --> 00:26:55,352
transforms into
a parallel world.

270
00:26:55,396 --> 00:26:58,051
A world where we were meant
to be all along.

271
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:00,836
- The machine can't run here,
and you know that.

272
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,316
It's going to cause a meltdown.

273
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,667
- Which is why I have been
trying to move my project.

274
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:08,670
Our tests here were quite
limited in proximity,

275
00:27:08,714 --> 00:27:10,454
however you left me no choice.

276
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,195
- Haven't you killed
enough people?

277
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:16,243
- Nobody will be killed.
The opposite, actually.

278
00:27:16,286 --> 00:27:18,245
We will be reborn as new,

279
00:27:18,288 --> 00:27:21,944
finally liberated from
the horrific and brutal past

280
00:27:21,988 --> 00:27:23,903
that we've been shackled
to for so long.

281
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:25,818
- You can't do this.

282
00:27:25,861 --> 00:27:27,733
You said you loved people,

283
00:27:27,776 --> 00:27:28,951
but you're not giving them
a choice.

284
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:30,039
You're not liberating them.

285
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,127
You're forcing this on them.

286
00:27:31,171 --> 00:27:33,913
- I am giving them a choice.

287
00:27:35,523 --> 00:27:37,960
That's why you're here.

288
00:27:38,004 --> 00:27:42,095
I'm going to show you
what I showed Angela.

289
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:45,751
- What do you mean?

290
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,492
- All I ever wanted from you,
Elliot,

291
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:52,801
was your belief.

292
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:55,761
- What are you gonna do
with that?

293
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:58,981
- I have learned to listen
when time speaks.

294
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:03,159
Our paths were too precisely
linked to this moment

295
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,900
for there not to be a reason.

296
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:06,206
This is why.

297
00:28:06,249 --> 00:28:08,077
You get to decide.

298
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:10,210
- Then I'm telling you,
don't do this!

299
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,066
- I don't know what
the fuck to do.

300
00:28:40,109 --> 00:28:41,937
- We need to figure out
the code to this door.

301
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,854
Try that phone.

302
00:28:45,898 --> 00:28:47,377
See if you can get
an outside line.

303
00:28:49,249 --> 00:28:53,862
- Zero five zero nine.
- Zero five zero nine.

304
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:56,473
- Zero five zero nine.

305
00:28:56,517 --> 00:28:58,780
- Anything?
- Zero five zero nine.

306
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:02,871
- Zero five zero nine.

307
00:29:02,915 --> 00:29:06,396
- Zero five zero nine.

308
00:29:15,231 --> 00:29:16,537
- Let's go!

309
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:20,019
There's an access tunnel
down the hall.

310
00:29:22,456 --> 00:29:24,850
- If we leave,

311
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,374
the nuclear reactor's
gonna melt down.

312
00:29:27,417 --> 00:29:29,419
- Which is why we need
to get as far fucking away

313
00:29:29,463 --> 00:29:30,594
from here as possible.

314
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:32,335
- If we don't stop this,

315
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,294
the meltdown will destroy
the whole town.

316
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:36,035
- You wanna stop the meltdown?

317
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:38,124
How the fuck
are we gonna do that?

318
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,564
- She said she gave me
a choice.

319
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:50,310
- We don't have time
for this shit.

320
00:29:56,316 --> 00:29:58,927
- I don't think this
is just a game.

321
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:01,887
- This place is gonna blow!

322
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,454
- This is an override process
to turn off the machine.

323
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,892
- We've gotta get
the fuck out of here!

324
00:31:20,574 --> 00:31:23,229
- It didn't work.
The alarms are still going.

325
00:31:23,272 --> 00:31:24,360
We've gotta go!

326
00:31:24,404 --> 00:31:29,452
- No, I'm missing something.

327
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:31,933
She wanted us to win.

328
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:50,011
- Did it work?

329
00:33:20,172 --> 00:33:24,002
It's too late,
isn't it?

330
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,818
- I love you.

331
00:34:05,695 --> 00:34:07,523
- I love you, too.

332
00:34:22,886 --> 00:34:25,193
- It's an exciting time
in the world.

333
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,746
- This is your wakeup call.

334
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,490
This is your wakeup call.

335
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:05,929
This is your wakeup call.

336
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,152
This is your wakeup call.

- Did you feel that?

370
00:37:20,716 --> 00:37:21,935
- Was that an earthquake?

371
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,763
- It can't be,
can it?

372
00:37:23,806 --> 00:37:26,287
In New York City?

373
00:37:26,331 --> 00:37:27,680
- I don't know.

374
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,508
- So weird.

375
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,988
Anyway, are you ready?

376
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,555
- For what?

377
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,296
- Presentation.

378
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,602
You said that you needed
to stay up all night

379
00:37:36,645 --> 00:37:41,563
working on it.

380
00:37:41,607 --> 00:37:42,956
- Oh, yeah.
Sorry.

381
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:45,915
I don't know where
my head is at.

382
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,657
- Are you okay?

383
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:52,270
- I woke up with
a really bad headache.

384
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,971
- I see you also haven't made
any progress on packing.

385
00:38:02,932 --> 00:38:04,499
- I bought tape.

386
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:10,505
- Okay, well,
that's not nothing.

387
00:38:11,854 --> 00:38:13,029
But it is almost nothing.

388
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:19,340
- My dad just E-mailed me.
I have to head into work.

389
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:21,734
- Don't tell me he's still
checking the traffic for you.

390
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:25,738
You are such an only child.

391
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:28,610
- You know me.

392
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:32,353
So I'll talk to you later,
okay?

393
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:34,964
- Elliot,

394
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,358
you're not keeping anything
from me, are you?

395
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:41,406
- What would I be keeping
from you?

396
00:38:42,885 --> 00:38:44,974
- I don't know.

397
00:38:45,018 --> 00:38:48,674
You just seem different.

398
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,854
- Must be this migraine
I woke up with.

399
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,899
- Now it's a migraine?

400
00:38:56,943 --> 00:38:58,945
I'll check in with you later?

401
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:00,686
Love you.

402
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:02,035
- I love you.

403
00:39:02,078 --> 00:39:04,994
- Hey.

404
00:39:05,038 --> 00:39:07,867
Can't wait to marry
you tomorrow.

405
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:28,104
- Your call has been forwarded
to an un--

406
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:46,209
- Mr. Robot,
computer repair with a smile.

407
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:48,037
This is Edward.
- Dad, where were you?

408
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,909
You're not answering your cell.

409
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:52,825
- Ah, you know I always loose
track of that thingamajig.

410
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:53,869
What's up, son?

411
00:39:53,913 --> 00:39:56,045
- I think Angela knows.

412
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,439
- That's impossible.

413
00:39:58,483 --> 00:39:59,875
- No, I just talked to her.

414
00:39:59,919 --> 00:40:01,921
She was acting suspicious.

415
00:40:01,964 --> 00:40:04,184
- I'm sure you're
just being paranoid.

416
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,925
There's no way she could know.

417
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,710
- Dad, I have a feeling,

418
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,887
if she finds out,
it will ruin everything.

419
00:40:11,931 --> 00:40:14,847
- Okay.
Calm down.

420
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:16,979
I'm sure you're just nervous
about tomorrow.

421
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,720
Try to act normal.

422
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:21,549
There's no way
she's gonna find out, okay?

423
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:23,072
- You're right.

424
00:40:23,116 --> 00:40:24,726
Okay.
- Just finishing up a call.

425
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:26,946
Be out in a jiff.

426
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,470
I got a customer.
We still on for lunch?

427
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:31,820
- Yeah.
- Okay.

428
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:32,952
See you soon.

429
00:40:32,995 --> 00:40:36,216
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

430
00:40:36,259 --> 00:40:38,653
- Thanks.

431
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:40,742
- No problem.

432
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:43,919
I'm always here for you.

433
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:47,532
- Sorry for the wait.
How can I help you?

434
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:53,494
Oh.

435
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:55,714
There you are.

436
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,509
- Residents of
the Tri-State area

437
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:10,990
were shaken up when
a 5.9 magnitude tremor

438
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,992
struck Washington Township,
New Jersey

439
00:41:13,035 --> 00:41:15,211
at about 7:30...
- Yo.

440
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:16,735
- Yo.

441
00:41:21,304 --> 00:41:22,958
Do you have that deck ready?

442
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:24,786
E Corp guys will
be here any minute.

443
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:25,831
- What?

444
00:41:25,874 --> 00:41:28,834
- For the meeting.

445
00:41:28,877 --> 00:41:30,618
- You just said E Corp.

446
00:41:30,662 --> 00:41:32,577
Don't you mean F Corp?

447
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,708
- F Corp.

448
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:35,101
Yeah, that's what I meant.

449
00:41:35,144 --> 00:41:36,624
- You nervous?

450
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:38,713
You're never like this
before presentation.

451
00:41:38,757 --> 00:41:42,587
You're always stone cold.

452
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,850
- Yeah, I don't know.
I'm not myself today, man.

453
00:41:44,893 --> 00:41:48,810
- What's up, my dudes?

454
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:49,942
- Ollie.

455
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,073
- Yeah, I heard we were taking

456
00:41:51,117 --> 00:41:53,728
a swing at F Corp today, B-Moc.

457
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:55,643
- I'm sorry?
- B-Moc.

458
00:41:55,687 --> 00:41:58,994
The Big Man on Campus.

459
00:41:59,038 --> 00:42:01,867
- I don't think that's a thing.
- It might be a stupid thing.

460
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,043
- Anyway, here's what's up.

461
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,175
I'm awesome at talking
to people.

462
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:07,350
For real, though.

463
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:08,961
Lunches, dinners, drinks.

464
00:42:09,004 --> 00:42:11,659
I could sell ice to an Arab,
sand to an Eskimo.

465
00:42:11,703 --> 00:42:14,575
- Yeah, you're not helping
yourself out there.

466
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:16,838
- Unless you're experimenting
with some new form or racism.

467
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:20,581
- I just want you to know I can
be an asset for when--not if--

468
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:22,583
but when you land this account.

469
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:25,978
What do you say?

470
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:27,719
You know what?
Don't take my word for it.

471
00:42:27,762 --> 00:42:29,068
I--I wanna take you out
to lunch

472
00:42:29,111 --> 00:42:30,896
and prove to you
what I'm all about.

473
00:42:30,939 --> 00:42:32,201
But not today, though.

474
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:34,769
I'm meeting my new girl,
Stella B.

475
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:37,032
Don't tell the girls
in the office.

476
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:41,820
Cool, man.
Glad we did this.

477
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:43,604
Seriously.

478
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:47,216
- Just pull up the debt
and look over all the slides.

479
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,131
- Let's build our
future together...

480
00:42:49,175 --> 00:42:50,829
- When you have lunch with him,

481
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,700
will you please tell him
to never talk to me again?

482
00:42:52,744 --> 00:42:56,312
- Together we can change
the world with F Corp.

483
00:42:58,227 --> 00:43:00,882
- Zhi Zhang,
the world's richest person,

484
00:43:00,926 --> 00:43:03,842
continues to make news for her
philanthropic endeavors.

485
00:43:03,885 --> 00:43:07,236
Last month Miss Zhang
donated $4.6 billion

486
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,109
to her personal charity,
the Whiterose Foundation,

487
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:11,806
according to
a filing published

488
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:13,721
by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.

489
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:16,245
- Earth to Elliot.

490
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:17,290
You all right?

491
00:43:21,163 --> 00:43:23,688
- Just make sure all
the flow charts are accurate.

492
00:43:23,731 --> 00:43:26,952
We really need
to land this account.

493
00:43:28,823 --> 00:43:30,085
- Okay.

494
00:43:47,712 --> 00:43:49,409
- With Allsafe at the wheel,

495
00:43:49,452 --> 00:43:51,846
F Corp can do
what they do best--

496
00:43:51,890 --> 00:43:55,154
navigate the world
to a brighter future.

497
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:57,939
Any questions?

498
00:44:01,726 --> 00:44:04,163
- Can Elliot and I
have the room, please?

499
00:44:19,831 --> 00:44:22,050
I appreciate your presentation,

500
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:25,271
but I don't think
this place is right for us.

501
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:31,320
- And why is that?

502
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,851
- Let me ask you something,
Elliot.

503
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:45,160
What's the worst thing
about your life right now?

504
00:44:46,161 --> 00:44:48,337
- Well, the fact that
you're passing on us already,

505
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:50,035
I'd have to go
with this meeting.

506
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:51,210
- No, seriously.

507
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:53,865
Answer my question.

508
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,044
- If I'm being honest...

509
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:03,831
The worst thing in my life...

510
00:45:06,094 --> 00:45:08,053
Is also the best thing.

511
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:13,841
I get up every morning,

512
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:16,365
I play my records,

513
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:18,019
I get ready,

514
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:21,370
get my coffee,
I come to work,

515
00:45:21,414 --> 00:45:25,070
I'm stuck in a repetitive,
boring routine

516
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:28,073
that feels endless.

517
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:34,035
And, sure, I've imagined
what it would be like

518
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:38,866
to be someone with
a more exciting life.

519
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:40,912
A risk-taker.

520
00:45:40,955 --> 00:45:44,176
Someone more interesting.

521
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:50,530
But in the end, I know
I'm lucky to be where I am.

522
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,928
- Please have a seat.

523
00:46:06,546 --> 00:46:12,204
I also feel the same about
my life at F Corp.

524
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:15,468
It's the best and the worst
thing that happened to me.

525
00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,820
And the reason why I love
my company so much

526
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:22,257
is because of
the value we provide,

527
00:46:22,301 --> 00:46:24,129
and people buy our products
every day

528
00:46:24,172 --> 00:46:25,478
because they trust us.

529
00:46:25,521 --> 00:46:27,436
F Corp is not only
the best thing in my life.

530
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,917
It's the best thing
in everyone's lives,

531
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:33,094
but it could also be the cause
of our undoing

532
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:35,314
if I'm not careful.

533
00:46:35,357 --> 00:46:38,273
So you see my dilemma here.

534
00:46:38,317 --> 00:46:43,496
- Tyrell, I pledge
to you right now

535
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:46,281
that if you go with Allsafe,

536
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:50,459
the worst will never happen.

537
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:54,289
- And how can you be so sure?

538
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:59,207
- Because I've seen what
can happen to your company,

539
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:02,950
and I know how to prevent it.

540
00:47:02,994 --> 00:47:06,388
- You've seen what can happen
to my company?

541
00:47:06,432 --> 00:47:10,088
- Yes.

542
00:47:10,131 --> 00:47:11,524
If you look through
our packets,

543
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:13,308
we've created predictive models

544
00:47:13,352 --> 00:47:14,962
for every possible
attack vector--

545
00:47:15,006 --> 00:47:17,399
- No, no, Elliot.

546
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:21,316
I just wanna know
you're on my side.

547
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,362
- Always.

548
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:29,455
- Come on, son.

549
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:33,459
You just landed the biggest
fish there is--F Corp.

550
00:47:33,502 --> 00:47:35,243
Celebrate!

551
00:47:37,419 --> 00:47:39,204
- Did you bring it?

552
00:47:47,212 --> 00:47:50,084
- A signed first-edition copy,

553
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:51,390
just like you asked.

554
00:47:59,572 --> 00:48:01,356
- Shoot.

555
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,273
I need to make sure Angela
isn't home when I drop it off.

556
00:48:05,317 --> 00:48:07,188
I think her mom's there.

557
00:48:15,022 --> 00:48:17,198
Hello?

558
00:48:17,242 --> 00:48:19,418
Emily?

559
00:48:21,246 --> 00:48:23,901
You there?

560
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:27,469
Weird.

561
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:30,211
She picked up
and then she hung up on me.

562
00:48:31,604 --> 00:48:33,084
- I bet she's with Angela

563
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:35,564
and doesn't want
to spoil the surprise.

564
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:37,392
Come on.

565
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:39,046
Let's order.
I'm hungry.

566
00:48:42,484 --> 00:48:44,269
- Forgot my wallet.

567
00:48:44,312 --> 00:48:47,315
Must have left it
at home this morning.

568
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,230
- That's not like you.

569
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:52,581
Must be nerves.

570
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,979
Okay.

571
00:48:59,023 --> 00:49:00,328
Here you go.

572
00:49:00,372 --> 00:49:03,027
You should buy her
some flowers, too.

573
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,117
But first,
we feast.

574
00:49:11,209 --> 00:49:12,993
- So you'll be gone
for a while?

575
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,168
- I already told you.

576
00:49:14,212 --> 00:49:16,475
Why do you keep asking me?

577
00:49:16,518 --> 00:49:18,520
- No reason.

578
00:49:18,564 --> 00:49:20,174
- What are you up to?

579
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:21,349
- Nothing.

580
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:27,007
- You're up to something.
I can tell.

581
00:49:27,051 --> 00:49:28,356
- Trust me.

582
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,444
- I trust you.

583
00:49:29,488 --> 00:49:31,272
I just don't believe you.

584
00:49:34,667 --> 00:49:36,712
- Your parents in town yet?

585
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:38,627
- Uh, yeah, they were
just at my place.

586
00:49:38,671 --> 00:49:40,455
I had to cancel lunch with
them because of work. Why?

587
00:49:40,499 --> 00:49:42,675
- Your dad sure loves to drink.

588
00:49:42,718 --> 00:49:44,416
- What's that?

589
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:46,113
- Never mind.

590
00:49:46,157 --> 00:49:52,511
Hey, I'm sorry I was acting
weird this morning.

591
00:49:52,554 --> 00:49:56,689
Just really excited
about tomorrow.

592
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:59,213
- What's tomorrow, again?

593
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:02,477
- Mm.

594
00:50:02,521 --> 00:50:04,305
What could it be?

595
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,526
- Well, I have a new
Pilates instructor

596
00:50:07,569 --> 00:50:08,744
I want you to try out.

597
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:10,572
- I'm not a big Pilates guy.

598
00:50:10,616 --> 00:50:12,792
- Oh, we're trying
that new sushi place

599
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,272
in Chelsea finally?

600
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:17,362
- Getting warmer.

601
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:21,192
- We're finally
getting married.

602
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:24,282
That couldn't be it,
could it?

603
00:50:24,325 --> 00:50:27,328
- ♪ 'Cause I've got
to lose myself tonight ♪

604
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:29,461
- Is the radio okay?

605
