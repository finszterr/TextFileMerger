Says, "You're gonna interview
Hermann Goring,

335
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,942
the Reichsmarschall himself."

336
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,597
Says, "Days, weeks,

337
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,991
however long it takes
to get him to talk."

338
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,603
Says, "I need you,
Doctor Senator, Esquire,

339
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:17,433
"to use your training,
your skills

340
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,958
to build the People's case."

341
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,004
Well, now,

342
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,093
what is that
if not the double victory?

343
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,008
Hmm?

344
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,011
So I sit with the man
for six weeks,

345
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,970
eight hours a day,
six days a week,

346
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,972
and we get into it.

347
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,627
The first two weeks,

348
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,978
he just stares at me,
murder in his eyes.

349
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,024
But I use my wiles.

350
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:45,635
You know, appeal to his ego.

351
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,028
Get him talking.

352
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:50,640
Ah. Soon he won't shut up.

353
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,642
Bragging
about every little thing,

354
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,644
and I type it down
and write it up for the colonel,

355
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,690
word-for-word.

356
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,822
I spend two weeks
crafting my conclusion,

357
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:01,521
my analysis
of international law.

358
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,653
Then, one Sunday morning,

359
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,308
after services,

360
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,528
I knock on the colonel's door

361
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:11,357
and I give him my report.

362
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,839
You know what he does?

363
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,146
Throws it in the trash.

364
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,192
Yeah.

365
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:24,848
400 pages with footnotes.

366
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:28,722
Throws it in the trash
and says...

367
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,159
"I just wanted to make

368
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,683
that old Nazi squirm..."

369
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:38,340
"...having to answer
to a Negro."

370
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,738
So...

371
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:48,089
you say respect the deal?

372
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,659
[silverware clatters]

373
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,272
Excuse me if I say

374
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:00,406
our word is exactly
as good as yours.

375
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,852
The slaughterhouses--
they belong to us.

376
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,421
Deal or no deal.

377
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,077
You can call it the cost
of transition.

378
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,430
I'll pass it on.

379
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,616
MILLIGAN:
There's no mystery to it.

380
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,315
Everything breaks, and there's
a right way to fix it.

381
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,450
Are you Jewish?

382
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,236
No.

383
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,283
Then how come
they call you Rabbi?

384
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,808
Isn't rabbi a Jewish priest?

385
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,115
You ever play poker?

386
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,904
But you know there's a game
called poker, played with cards.

387
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:09,300
Well, there's this saying
in poker:

388
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,738
you play the hand you're dealt.

389
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,395
You and me, we're proof of that.

390
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:24,054
You see, when yours truly
was a boy,

391
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,361
he had the same thing happen
to him, what happened to you.

392
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,322
SATCHEL:
You got traded?

393
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:32,802
What?

394
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,804
From baseball.

395
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,327
That's what my daddy said.

396
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,852
I got traded to another team.

397
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,813
Exactly.

398
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,034
I got traded twice.

399
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,865
Except, well, for you,
you get to go back

400
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,824
to your original team one day.

401
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,697
Is this your original team?

402
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:58,698
No.

403
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,830
My team was shite.

404
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,487
[door opens]

405
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,238
What are these words?

406
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,501
Team, traded?

407
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:20,981
It's nothing.

408
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:22,809
Doesn't matter.

409
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,681
Say it again.

410
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,248
I want to... I want to hear.

411
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,380
-Yeah.
-We'll get out of your way.

412
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,472
[Gaetano laughs]

413
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:38,215
This was our home in Italy,
my country.

414
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,522
Yeah.
[chuckles]

415
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,219
The fascists knock it down,

416
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,744
and so I live in the trees.

417
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,746
[chuckles]

418
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,225
[sighs]

419
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:54,405
[chuckles]

420
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:03,502
So... you're Irish, hmm?

421
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,592
American.

422
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,724
I'm American.

423
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,034
[sighs]

424
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,865
But you came to us
when you were just a boy.

425
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:26,873
And you killed
your own father...

426
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,049
for us.

427
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,269
What's that like?

428
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,584
[gunshot]

429
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,107
Who remembers?

430
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,153
"Who remembers?"
I like it.

431
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,111
[Gaetano chuckles]

432
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,288
What the fuck is this?

433
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,075
I got it.

434
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,644
A trade, yeah?

435
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,821
You, Rabbi, for you.

436
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:02,822
Hmm.

437
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,432
Come on, kid.

438
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,086
Get out of my chair.

439
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,958
No.

440
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,657
I like it.

441
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,615
It's too big for you, no?

442
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,748
Up.

443
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,800
Did you make trouble at
the slaughterhouse last night?

444
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,933
Who, me?

445
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,588
I take care of things.

446
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,981
I'm the boss, I'm the one
who takes care of things.

447
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:35,115
[Gaetano laughing]

448
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,509
You?

449
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:42,165
You can't even take care
of this doctor

450
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,864
who kicks our family
out on the street.

451
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,344
What'd you say to me?

452
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:48,781
-You can't even take care of...
-[Satchel sneezes]

453
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,001
Why is he in here?

454
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,524
-This is my office.
-My mistake.

455
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,178
Your man asked me
to fix the radiator.

456
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,353
I...

457
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,834
There's secret stuff here.

458
00:26:59,008 --> 00:26:59,835
And he's a...

459
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,402
Think.

460
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,360
Retard, use your head next time.

461
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,710
And you.

462
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,146
You think I can't take care

463
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,190
of some piece-of-shit
pencil pusher?

464
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,844
Is that what you think?!

465
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,716
Mm-hmm.

466
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,196
Get out.

467
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,024
All of you.

468
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,077
You follow orders.

469
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,253
You hear me?
Or go home.

470
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,560
What are you doing?
Put that back.

471
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:33,695
[clicks tongue]

472
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,572
[whispering]:
Look at this fucking mess.

473
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,362
It's not too big.

474
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,538
It's just right.

475
00:27:55,935 --> 00:27:57,458
[Harvard grunts]

476
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:02,419
[sighs]
You were at St. Bartholomew's.

477
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,552
Yes, sir, three years.

478
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:05,901
Good souls all, but...

479
00:28:06,075 --> 00:28:08,164
[sighs]

480
00:28:08,338 --> 00:28:10,906
I like to go where I feel
I can be most useful,

481
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,126
and I heard
you might have hardship.

482
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,606
Three of our older nurses
retired last month.

483
00:28:15,781 --> 00:28:17,130
[sighs]

484
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:18,784
Experience--

485
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,308
it can't be bought.

486
00:28:21,482 --> 00:28:24,311
Now, I myself have
over ten years' service,

487
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:25,834
starting as a candy striper

488
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:28,489
and delivering treats
to the tots.

489
00:28:28,663 --> 00:28:31,318
You worked for Allen Sneet?

490
00:28:31,492 --> 00:28:33,973
Yes, sir.
He's a fair boss.

491
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:36,105
considerate but firm.

492
00:28:37,977 --> 00:28:40,066
He'll give you
a good recommendation?

493
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,284
Hmm.

494
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,895
Well, I should hope so.

495
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:46,855
I used to bake him
cookies once a week.

496
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,119
We are shorthanded right now.

497
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,121
Well, you can't have that,

498
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:54,515
what with cold and flu season
coming on.

499
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:01,348
Can you start next week?

500
00:29:03,176 --> 00:29:05,831
I'll be here with bells on.

501
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,486
Fine.

502
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,488
Go see Mrs. Meeker
in the office.

503
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:14,317
-She'll start the paperwork.
-Oh. [chuckles]

504
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:18,191
If-if there is one thing I love,
it's a man of action

505
00:29:18,365 --> 00:29:20,193
who just knows what he wants
and goes for it.

506
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,673
Y-You won't regret this, sir.

507
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,719
[stammers]
Just so I'm in the know,

508
00:29:24,893 --> 00:29:27,853
what's your favorite sweet,
baked or otherwise?

509
00:29:28,027 --> 00:29:29,855
That won't be necessary.

510
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:31,334
Come now.

511
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:33,467
Everyone's got a birthday.

512
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:38,211
I am-- hmm--

513
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:40,517
partial to the macaroon.

514
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:44,304
Mmm.
Challenge accepted.

515
00:29:44,478 --> 00:29:45,348
[laughs softly]

516
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,176

But you must've knew
it wouldn't stick.

305
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,991
Well, he gave permission,
the old man.

306
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,514
Last week at the playground.

307
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,299
[scoffs]

308
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,041
Well, you tell me one thing

309
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,391
ever got given to you
in this world

310
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,567
that you didn't have to take.
Hmm?

311
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,308
And I'm saying...

312
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,702
...respect the deal.

313
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,319
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

314
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,541
You didn't serve in the war,
did you?

315
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,588
[grunts]

316
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,590
I was in the legal corps.

317
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,201
Army. Pushing papers.

318
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,247
After the cease-fire,

319
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,598
they send me to Nuremberg
for the trials.

320
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:28,036
Last Negro in Germany,
I'd imagine.

321
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,603
Mm-hmm.

322
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,910
You ever heard of the Double V?

323
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,043
Hmm.

324
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,045
It's what they sold us.

325
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,742
Mm-hmm.

326
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,267
Fight for our country,
and we get two victories.

327
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:44,618
One for America and one
for we sons of servitude.

328
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,054
No more lynchings.

329
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,622
No more blackjacks at the polls.

330
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,972
Hmm? Okay.

331
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:54,584
So, they send me to Nuremberg,

332
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,630
and this colonel tells me

333
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,980
he's got a big job for me.

334
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:02,592
Says, "You're gonna interview
Hermann Goring,

335
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,942
the Reichsmarschall himself."

336
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,597
Says, "Days, weeks,

337
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,991
however long it takes
to get him to talk."

338
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,603
Says, "I need you,
Doctor Senator, Esquire,

339
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:17,433
"to use your training,
your skills

340
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,958
to build the People's case."

341
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,004
Well, now,

342
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,093
what is that
if not the double victory?

343
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,008
Hmm?

344
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,011
So I sit with the man
for six weeks,

345
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,970
eight hours a day,
six days a week,

346
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,972
and we get into it.

347
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,627
The first two weeks,

348
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,978
he just stares at me,
murder in his eyes.

349
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,024
But I use my wiles.

350
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:45,635
You know, appeal to his ego.

351
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,028
Get him talking.

352
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:50,640
Ah. Soon he won't shut up.

353
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,642
Bragging
about every little thing,

354
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,644
and I type it down
and write it up for the colonel,

355
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,690
word-for-word.

356
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,822
I spend two weeks
crafting my conclusion,

357
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:01,521
my analysis
of international law.

358
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,653
Then, one Sunday morning,

359
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,308
after services,

360
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,528
I knock on the colonel's door

361
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:11,357
and I give him my report.

362
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,839
You know what he does?

363
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,146
Throws it in the trash.

364
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,192
Yeah.

365
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:24,848
400 pages with footnotes.

366
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:28,722
Throws it in the trash
and says...

367
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,159
"I just wanted to make

368
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,683
that old Nazi squirm..."

369
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:38,340
"...having to answer
to a Negro."

370
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,738
So...

371
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:48,089
you say respect the deal?

372
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,659
[silverware clatters]

373
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,272
Excuse me if I say

374
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:00,406
our word is exactly
as good as yours.

375
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,852
The slaughterhouses--
they belong to us.

376
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,421
Deal or no deal.

377
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,077
You can call it the cost
of transition.

378
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,430
I'll pass it on.

379
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,616
MILLIGAN:
There's no mystery to it.

380
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,315
Everything breaks, and there's
a right way to fix it.

381
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,450
Are you Jewish?

382
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,236
No.

383
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,283
Then how come
they call you Rabbi?

384
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,808
Isn't rabbi a Jewish priest?

385
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,115
You ever play poker?

386
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,904
But you know there's a game
called poker, played with cards.

387
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:09,300
Well, there's this saying
in poker:

388
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,738
you play the hand you're dealt.

389
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,395
You and me, we're proof of that.

390
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:24,054
You see, when yours truly
was a boy,

391
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,361
he had the same thing happen
to him, what happened to you.

392
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,322
SATCHEL:
You got traded?

393
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:32,802
What?

394
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,804
From baseball.

395
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,327
That's what my daddy said.

396
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,852
I got traded to another team.

397
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,813
Exactly.

398
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,034
I got traded twice.

399
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,865
Except, well, for you,
you get to go back

400
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,824
to your original team one day.

401
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,697
Is this your original team?

402
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:58,698
No.

403
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,830
My team was shite.

What are these words?

Team, traded?

407
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:20,981
It's nothing.

408
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:22,809
Doesn't matter.

409
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,681
Say it again.

410
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,248
I want to... I want to hear.

411
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,380
-Yeah.
-We'll get out of your way.

413
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:38,215
This was our home in Italy,
my country.

00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,522
Yeah.
[chuckles]

415
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,219
The fascists knock it down,

416
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,744
and so I live in the trees.

00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:03,502
So... you're Irish, hmm?

421
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,592
American.

422
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,724
I'm American.

[sighs]

424
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,865
But you came to us
when you were just a boy.

425
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:26,873
And you killed
your own father...

426
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,049
for us.

427
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,269
What's that like?

429
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,107
Who remembers?

430
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,153
"Who remembers?"
I like it.

[Gaetano chuckles]

432
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,288
What the fuck is this?

433
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,075
I got it.

434
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,644
A trade, yeah?

435
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,821
You, Rabbi, for you.

436
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:02,822
Hmm.

437
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,432
Come on, kid.

It's too big for you, no?

Up.

00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,800
Did you make trouble at
the slaughterhouse last night?

444
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,933
Who, me?

445
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,588
I take care of things.

446
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,981
I'm the boss, I'm the one
who takes care of things.

You can't even take care

out on the street.

-You can't even take care of...

Why is he in here?

-This is my office.
-My mistake.

455
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,178
Your man asked me
to fix the radiator.

Or go home.

I like to go where I feel
I can be most useful,

and I heard
you might have hardship.

00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,773
Oh, shoot.
I've got to fly.

241
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:11,558
Now, will you just
put some things away,

242
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,560
so that when I come home tonight
I don't feel like

243
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,866
jumping out the window
with everything such a jumble?

244
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,565
Uh, do you want me
to wash these dishes?

245
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,741
Oh, would you?
That'd be swell.

246
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:23,918
Oh, and while you're at it,
my room's just down the hallway.

247
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:27,226
So if you're doing dishes, you
might as well clean the sheets.

248
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,663
[quietly]:
Sheets.

249
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,754
[door creaks, closes]

250
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,019
-What's in there?
-Oh, never you mind about that.

251
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:39,586
Now, like I said,

252
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,110
there's, uh, there's
French-playing records

253
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,721
just by the hi-fi, and, uh,

254
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:47,898
yeah, you can borrow
any book you like.

255
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,813
How much?

256
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,250
How much what?

257
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,469
The way I see it,
this whole place--

258
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,211
sheets, dishes,
three hours' work--

259
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,213
that's at least a dollar.

260
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,696
Well, aren't you
a little capitalist.

261
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,095
[Antoon snoring]

262
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,578
Hey.

263
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,667
What the hell
are you doing here?

264
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,713
I got to tell you something.

265
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,889
What?

266
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:27,111
You're gonna hear talk,
about me,

267
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,940
something I did
or maybe didn't do.

268
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:31,725
Shining a bad light, I mean.

269
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,683
Just be aware of whose lips
are doing the flapping.

270
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,642
You being a fink? It sounds like
you're being a fink.

271
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:38,253
-I botched a hit.
-You botched... How's that?

272
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,996
The Cannon boy.
Lemuel.

273
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,346
Calamita said get in the car,
so I got in the car.

274
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,174
We tailed the kid.
He said light him up.

275
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,871
I'm sinking my teeth
into your jugular

276
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,264
-if this story ends with...
-No, no, no. It don't.

277
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,658
Like I said,
he told me to open up,

278
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,660
but events didn't feel right.

279
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,618
"On whose authority?" I ask him,

280
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,055
but he don't say,
so I laid on the kibosh.

281
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,057
But the kid saw my fangs,
no doubt.

282
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,668
And look, look,
if you ordered it,

283
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,496
I got no problem
accepting consequence.

284
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,149
But I know you don't want
to start a war.

285
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,021
I didn't order a goddamn hit!

286
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,155
So you're saying what?
Gaetano?

287
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,810
You're telling me that porkpie,
ziti-eating greaser

288
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,638
is giving my boys orders now?

289
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,119
That sticky golem wop.

290
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,468
[grunts]

291
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,862
Gotta be kidding me.
[grunts]

292
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,995
[grunts]

293
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:27,041
[exhales]

294
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,221
-[whistles]
-[grunts]

295
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,266
-Look. Here.
-[engine starts]

296
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,747
You're a good boy.
Reliable.

297
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,183
-You're with me, right?
-Mm-hmm.

298
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,577
All right.
You're gonna watch 'em.

299
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,449
-Who?
-All of 'em.

300
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,320
You're like a fucking bird
on a wire, got me?

301
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:46,495
Eyes in the back of your head.

302
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,671
What about Calamita?

303
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,718
Uh, don't worry, he'll get his.

304
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,415
It's a new day.
Got me?

305
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,938
Spring fucking cleaning.

306
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,680
You're either loyal,
or you're with him.

307
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,205
Find that cop, Odis.

308
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,686
Tell him to come to the club,
rapid fire.

309
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,176
[car door closes]

310
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,569
[car departs]

311
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:21,400
That's right.
The Pump and Go out on Route 16.

312
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:23,619
I'm the nightman.

313
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:26,361
You might tell the marshal
what you told me.

314
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:29,712
About the lesbians?

315
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,279
Well, there was two of them.

316
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,238
Uh, a injun
and-and a colored woman.

317
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:37,111
And they were conversing.

318
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,243
Y-Yes, sir, that's correct.

319
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:43,552
About?

320
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,299
I'm asking what was the nature
of the exchange?

321
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,302
Oh.
Uh, just, uh...

322
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,565
normal chitchat.

323
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,525
See, I th-thought you said

324
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,441
they were talking about
skipping town.

325
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,140
When you called me.

326
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,491
Right. Yeah.
Skipping town.

327
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:10,927
That's affirmative.

328
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:13,147
Uh, said they was headed
to Chicago.

329
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,801
Chicago?

330
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,368
Yes, sir.
Chicago.

331
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:20,067
S-Said they was on their way.

332
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,635
There it is.

333
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,072
Guess they flew the coop.
[chuckles]

334
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,644
[sighs]

335
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:37,650
I'll, uh, I'll walk you out.

336
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,698
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Sinclair.

337
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:46,354
-What's this?
-Don't be an idiot.

338
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,487
[knocking and grunting
rhythmically]

339
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,318
Least I know how to open
a damn door.

340
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,855
Guess you're off
to Chicago, then, buddy.

341
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,205
That's too bad. We were just
starting to hit it off.

342
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:12,598
Funny story.

343
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,165
What?

344
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,167
We're a national agency,
turns out.

345
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:18,821
The U.S. Marshal Service.

346
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,997
We got offices in Chicago,

347
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,696
Indianapolis, all over.

348
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,480
-[exhales]
-So, I'll pass along the tip,

349
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,003
but Kansas City was my mandate,

350
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:30,224
and Kansas City
is where I'll stay.

351
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:33,270
You know,
in case they circle back.

352
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,708
-[stammers]
-[footsteps approaching]

353
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,543
[sharp exhale]

354
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:47,546
That's fine.
I just thought...

355
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,332
-I got to run an errand.
-An errand?

356
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:53,552
[exhales]

357
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,511
See a snitch, I'm saying.
An informant?

358
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,731
You probably...
We got a code.

359
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:00,646
Well, hell,
why didn't you say so?

360
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,779
-I'll drive.
-That's... D-Don't...

361
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,781
don't, don't, don't,
don't trouble yourself.

362
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,523
Amigo, please.
It's the least I can do.

363
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,367
You giving orders now?

364
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:38,292
Calm down.

365
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,729
What?

366
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:42,862
[chuckles]

367
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,475
Okay.

368
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,998
It's a gunfight, asshole.

369
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,478
[gunshot]

370
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:56,266
What is this--
your little war council?

371
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,404
Boss, I told them
to wait for you.

372
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:04,971
Did you know?

373
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,280
...took a shot at Loy's kid.
Did you know?

374
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:12,718
EBAL: I just found out
from the consigliere.

375
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,853
And you-- you're lucky
my man was there.

376
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:19,202
Or I'd be cutting your throat

377
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,596
with a can of cat food
right now.

378
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,863
Ayo.They stole from us.

379
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:30,779
This morning,
these mulignani.Yeah.

380
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,607
300 guns.

381
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:40,310
Because they think that...
we are weak.

382
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,837
They're right.
You're weak.

383
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,665
You're weak.

384
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,842
You took a shot, you missed.

385
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,148
Now my enemy's got,

386
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:55,021
what, 300 guns?

387
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:57,371
Congratulations.

388
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:07,163
Do it.

389
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:09,209
Please.
Do it.

390
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,215
Do it.

391
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:32,885
[sheathes knife]

392
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,149
Bang.

393
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,198
Violante.

[door closes]

397
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:10,226
It's not his fault.
Come on.

00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:35,861
[parking brake clicks]

399
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:41,867
I'll be a minute.

400
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,087
[grunting rhythmically]

401
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,220
Is this the minute?

402
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,268
-I could come with.
-No.

403
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:55,402
No, no. I-I got to...
Don't want to spook him.

405
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,925
Son?

406
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,884
Have you accepted
Jesus Christ into your heart?

407
00:30:43,058 --> 00:30:45,800
-Get the fuck out of here.
-What's the ordeal upstairs?

408
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,497
Booze?
Gambling?

409
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:50,152
If a man's pud need a tug,

410
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:53,286
would this be the place
for said tugging?

411
00:30:57,986 --> 00:30:59,901
What's that supposed to mean?

412
00:31:00,075 --> 00:31:01,860
You'll see.

413
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,168
Morning.

414
00:31:06,342 --> 00:31:07,953
Ouch.

[crash]

102
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,663
Odis here was in the war.

103
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,535
Minesweeper.

104
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,972
Every day, take his men...

105
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,150
...and hoof it on ahead
of the army,

106
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,326
looking for land mines.

107
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,460
You shut up.

108
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:18,073
Lot of turnover in Odis' unit.

109
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,205
Boom!
There goes Sammy.

110
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,252
Boom!
There goes Mike.

111
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,734
Whole thing started to make
Odis a little twitchy.

112
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,475
Until, one day,

113
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,477
he couldn't take it no more.

114
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,305
So he laid down in the grass.

115
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,483
Just looks at the clouds.

116
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:41,183
Army rolls up.

117
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,315
Colonel says,

118
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,839
"Odis,

119
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,145
did you clear this field?"

120
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,365
And Odis says,

121
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,194
-"Yes, sir."
-[gasping]

122
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:53,543
-See...
-I cleared it.

123
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,371
Colonel had to take a piss.

124
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,505
So he walks out into the field
and...

125
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,073
Boom!

126
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,514
They got to send him home
in a tureen.

127
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,868
That's a pot they put soup in.

128
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,351
[hoarsely]:
Get 'em out of here.

129
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,397
Not-not him.

130
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,399
OFFICER:
Get 'em all out. Go.

131
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:24,879
OFFICER 2:
You heard him.

132
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,713
[stammers, exhales]

133
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,065
You didn't fight in the war,
did you?

134
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,763
Nah, man.

135
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:43,245
Why would I fight for a country
that wants me dead?

136
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,466
[chuckles]
Boom!

137
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,646
Josto Fadda says...

138
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,431
stick to the deal.

139
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,088
Boom!

[groaning loudly]

144
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:03,368

ETHELRIDA:
Dear Dr. Harvard...

146
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,162
I am writing
to inform you of the actions

147
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:15,685
of one of your nurses.

148
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,034
[knocking]

149
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,209
[door opens]

150
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,646
THURMAN:
Decent?

151
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,520
Lights out.

152
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,522
Big day tomorrow.

153
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,132
What?

154
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,395
Your birthday.

155
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,658
Don't tell me you forgot.

156
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,355
[exhales]
Yeah.

157
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,053
Right, it's a... it's a big day.

158
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,491
Hey, Dad, what...
what's laudanum?

159
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,668
Chemistry homework?

160
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,671
Not exactly.

161
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:47,021
Well, let's see.

162
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,326
Laudanum, it's a...

163
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,111
it's a painkiller.

164
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,155
Real potent.

165
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,722
Is it dangerous?

166
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:56,900
Could be, if you take too much.
Why?

167
00:09:57,074 --> 00:10:00,512
I saw it at Mrs. Mayflower's,
across the way.

168
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,558
Tons.

169
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,866
Well, hon, she is a nurse.

170
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:08,782
But it's not something
she should be keeping

171
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,392
around the house.

172
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,524
Lights out now, okay?

173
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,049
Okay, Daddy.

174
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,227
Dad.

175
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:24,275
Are we ever gonna
see Aunt Zelmare again?

176
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,323
Of course we will.

177
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,455
She's just, you know,

178
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,067
an escaped convict, so...

179
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,721
Where'd she go?

180
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,594
She's, um...

181
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,597
Well, I don't know that you
need to know that, young lady.

182
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,082
She's at a residential hotel
downtown, holed up.

183
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:51,172
The New Parie or some such.

184
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,436
But don't you even think of
going down there, you hear me?

185
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,093
Okay.

186
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,404
Listen...

187
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,102
this Miss Mayflower.

188
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,104
She's...

189
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,280
she's not really...

190
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:15,022
I mean, I'm sure
she's real nice,

191
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,807
but she's not someone
you should be hanging around.

192
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,940
Huh?

193
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,986
We got a real precarious
situation here,

194
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,641
living outside the law and all.

195
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,512
So...

196
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,384
Not to mention,
I think she might've

197
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,429
poisoned that pie she baked us.

198
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,996
Anyway,

199
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,477
steer clear.

200
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:37,000
All right.

201
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,481
Say hello to the sandman,
birthday girl.

I've worked alongside
Oraetta Mayflower

203
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,987
for many years now...

-[groaning]
-[thud]

205
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:12,644
...and felt that I should bring certain actions of hers

206
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,256
to your attention.

207
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,346
In the last year,

208
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,522
many of Nurse Mayflower's
patients have died

209
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,177
under mysterious circumstances.

[fanfare plays over radio]

211
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:43,545
NEWSMAN [over radio]:
President Truman,
asking Congress

212
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,634
for strong
anti-inflation laws, says

213
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,593
we must remain strong at home
to beat worldwide communism.

214
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,465
TRUMAN:
And the way to do it is

215
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,858
to have
an anti-inflation program,

216
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,903
including price controls,

217
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,863
wage controls, rent controls,
credit controls--

218
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,908
controls that really

219
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,215
hold down prices
and the cost of living.

220

You carry the five,
don't forget.

[Josto sighs]

222
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:08,135
What's he working on?

223
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:11,878
Satchel, tell the boss
what you're working on.

224
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,444
Long division.

225
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:16,578
You're teaching him?

226
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,320
-I'm bad at math.
-Funny.

227
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,626
No one ever says
"I'm bad at English."

228
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,412
What?

229
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,066
Nothing.

230
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:31,071
We got 'em on the run, I think,
after last night.

231
00:13:31,245 --> 00:13:33,943
The way I figure, he'll go home.

00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:38,948
This thing's rightly sorted,
there's no war to fight.

234
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:41,081
He'll go home.

235
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,475
Would you?

236
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:48,349
Would I what?

237
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:51,439
Italy's over.
We turned it into a toilet.

238
00:13:51,613 --> 00:13:54,311
This is the land of plenty.

240
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,446
Would you go back?

241
00:14:01,144 --> 00:14:03,320
Maybe he gets
another city, then.

00:14:05,453 --> 00:14:07,281
Yeah, Moreno's in Cleveland.

No, you watch.

245
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:12,852
Train's gonna pull in next week,
maybe earlier--

246
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:15,376
ten, 20 guys
from the old country.

247
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,032
"I just thought we could
use the help," he'll say,

248
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:21,121
your brother,
but make no mistake.

249
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:25,125
Those are his men...

250
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:27,301
and they're here to take over.

251
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,956
So what do we do?

252
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,089
Making me say it

253
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,962
instead of you isn't gonna
make doing it any easier.

254
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,887
Plenty of people
are bad at English.

255
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,715
Yeah, but they're not
proud of it.

256
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,631
This problem you got--
it's a math problem.

257
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,851
Either you divide them

258
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,332
or they multiply.

259
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:01,335
Capisce?

260
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,730
I got to piss.

261
00:15:14,826 --> 00:15:16,698
Be ready.

262
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,181
When the shooting starts,

263
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,010
we vanish.

It's the niece.

[whistles two notes]

269
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:20,109
So we know
you're friendly next time.

270
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,155
Hey, you got any food on you?

271
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,418
There's too much heat
in the street to go out,

272
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,637
and we ate all the saltines
last night.

273
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:29,771
[sighs]
I got some pretzels in my bag.

274
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,167
You want a drink?

275
00:16:34,341 --> 00:16:35,733
We're drinking.

276
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,605
No, ma'am.

00:16:37,779 --> 00:16:40,129
Come on, now.
It's your birthday.

278
00:16:40,303 --> 00:16:42,131
You're grown.

00:16:42,305 --> 00:16:44,307
[laughs]
What, you thought I forgot?

280
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,918
Shit, I wish I could be
with y'all to celebrate,

281
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:48,355
eat me some cake.

282
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:51,140
-Cake?

I sleep like a baby.

647
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:22,517
You understand?

648
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:25,738
I will do
whatever it takes to win.

649
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:30,743
Yes, sir.

650
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,318
Get the boy a piece of cake.

651
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,283
[dish clatters]

652
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,791
Your business is mine now.

653
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,837
You'll sign over the deed
this afternoon.

654
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,974
Um...

655
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:32,413
Mr. Cannon, p-please.

656
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:35,068
No, no.
We're past "please."

657
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,200
Now we're at,
"Whatever you want, boss.

658
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,941
Just don't kill me."

659
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,466
Also, you're gonna tell me
where your sister's at.

660
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,643
Oh, yeah,
I've been doing some asking.

661
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:47,472
Zelmare Roulette.

662
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,909
[chuckles softly]
Some name.

663
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,172
Her and her butch Indian.

664
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:55,523
They broke out of prison
and now they're here.

665
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,177
Well, I want 'em.

666
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,180
What are you gonna do?

667
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,488
Whatever the fuck I want.

668
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,490
-It's my fault.
-Thurman.

669
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:08,057
No.

670
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,669
I should have asked her
where she got the...

671
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:14,499
But... it's my first time, see?

672
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:16,675
Owing money to a...

673
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:20,069
And I didn't...

674
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,724
The rules, you know?
What are the rules?

675
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:26,119
LOY:
The rules are you tell me
what I want to know,

676
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:28,121
or I paint this room with you

677
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,515
and wait for your daughter
to come home.

678
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,742
Okay.

679
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,875
-[school bell rings]
-[indistinct chatter]

680
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:50,056
Well... I'm here.

681
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,927
What's the rumpus?

682
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:55,409
I knew you were trouble
moment I laid eyes on you.

683
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,289
Miss Smutny.

684
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,378
Inside.

685
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:10,903
Now.

686
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:25,308
In all my years
of educating colored children,

687
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,572
I never had a U.S. marshal
come to my office

688
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,922
and ask to talk to a student.

689
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:33,795
You mind giving us a minute?

690
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:40,454
[door opens]

691
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,805
[door closes]

692
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,810
I've been thinking about you.

693
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,074
About me?

694
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,337
Mm-hmm.

695
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,514
Straight A student, I'm told.

696
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:58,516
Speaks a foreign language.

697
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,300
My Lord.

698
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,133
Your aunt, on the other hand--

699
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,570
she goes on a cough-syrup bender

700
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,573
that ends in the pistol grip
bludgeoning of a pregnant woman

701
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:15,141
and the prayerful execution
of her husband.

702
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:17,535
An armed robbery
that netted Zelmare Roulette

703
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,798
all of $9.58.

704
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:26,369
You thought she was in jail
for littering?

705
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:30,983
Oh, and then there's
her paramour, Swanee Capps.

706
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:33,159
She was the third wheel
on a bank robbery crew

707
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,161
that killed a bank manager
father of three

708
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:37,380
and the coach
of a peewee football team.

709
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,513
This is who you're protecting.

710
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:44,170
I know they're family.

711
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:46,389
And I know there,
on the north side of town,

712
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,783
colored folks talk
about "us versus them"

713
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:50,611
and "we got to stick together"
and what have you.

714
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:53,483
But if you deem yourself
a civilized person--

715
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,007
and I know you do--

716
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:58,358
you've got to act
in a civilized manner.

717
00:42:58,532 --> 00:43:00,708
End of story.

718
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:02,710
So...

719
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:05,365
I'm asking.

720
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:08,194
Where's your auntie at?

721
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:12,198
Civilized?

722
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,374
Mm-hmm.
That's what I said.

723
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:17,072
You know, do you not,
that Africa is

724
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,292
the birthplace of civilization?

725
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:22,208
Which means both
your ancestors and mine

726
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:24,602
came from the same
green savannah.

727
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,127
I got an A in anthropology.

728
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,216
That's factual.

729
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:36,701
[laughs]

730
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:40,705
Fascinating.

731
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:44,622
But...
[laughs]

732
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:48,060
Listen, I've been mired in
this town going on ten days now,

733
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:49,583
and I need to get home
to the wife and kids,

734
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,454
so I'll make this simple.

735
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,414
Tell me where your aunt is
or I'll get you expelled.

736
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:59,245
-Sir...
-Oh, now it's "sir."

737
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,163
-Please.
-No.

738
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:07,601
The Lord said shake the tree,
and I'm shaking it.

739
00:44:07,775 --> 00:44:11,170
Your life or hers.
One of 'em's getting ruined.

740
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,955
Which one is up to you.

741
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:28,100
Boss, let me explain.

742
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:30,929
Get him home.
His mama's worried sick.

743
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:33,758
You can handle that, right?

744
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:36,238
Of course I can. I didn't
even want to be in there.

745
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:37,762
Later.

746
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:47,249
Ready to work?

747
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,295
Yes, sir.

748
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:50,644
We leave in five.

749
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,472
Arm up.

750
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,306
Calling all cars.

751
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,178
Suspect fugitives are holed up
at the New Parie Hotel.

752
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:05,137
I am inbound, requesting backup.

753
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,355
DISPATCHER:
Roger that.

754
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:08,401
[laughs]

755
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,796
I could get used to this.

756
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,320
What, masticating savory vittles

757
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:16,365
and imbibing top-shelf hooch?

758
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:17,845
Hoo-wee!

759
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,500
Someone's been studying
their vocabulary.

760
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:23,982
I am trying to be punctilious
with my locution.

761
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,419
Girl, I don't know
what you just said,

762
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:28,377
but I like the way it sound.

763
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,510
[both laughing]

764
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:34,514
[Zelmare and Swanee gasp]

765
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:35,863
OPAL:
Hands.

766
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:38,170
Ladies.

767
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,478
Cover yourselves up.

768
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:43,915
Never mind that.

769
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:46,265
Let's get this over with.

770
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:48,223
-LOY: You're the puker?
-[clicks tongue]

771
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:49,703
So you must be the shooter.

772
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:51,357
Give me my gun,
and I'll show you.

773
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:52,837
LOY:
They got spirit.

774
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:56,231
God help me,
I love a girl with spirit.

775
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,842
Get dressed.

776
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,673
[car door closes]

777
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,545
SWANEE:
Mister,

778
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,765
either rape us
or kill us already.

779
00:46:09,027 --> 00:46:11,203
LOY:
Dying's too easy.

780
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:14,293
You owe me,
and I'm putting you to work.

781
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,469
-We ain't whores.
-Don't need whores.

782
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:18,776
Need soldiers,
invisiblesoldiers.

783
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,648
Soldiers the other side
can't see coming.

784
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:24,129
Who's more invisible than you?

785
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:25,870
DEAFY:
Which room

786
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,350
are the two jailbirds in--
the Negro and the Injun?

787
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,570
313.

788
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:35,096
We don't like bosses.

789
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:38,883
You like bullets?

790
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:42,582
What do you want us to do?

791
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:56,596
[car doors close]

792
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,990
[engine starts]

793
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:00,252
ZELMARE:
Hey, hey,

794
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:01,340
don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

795
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:02,471
[engine starts]

796
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:04,647
[car door closes]

797
00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:11,959
Son of a biscuit.

798
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:21,751
Good afternoon.

799
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:23,928
Afternoon.

800
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,453
Cup of joe, Doc?

801
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,852
Not today, Nadine.

802
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,785
Am I talking to you,

803
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,484
or am I talking to him?

804
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,790
Please.
[sniffles]

805
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:02,662
Have a seat.

806
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:04,838
Where is the consigliere?

807
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,973
Please.

808
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:16,154
[Calamita laughs]

809
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,898
You ever...

810
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,468
You ever see a baby in a box?

811
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:27,687
What?

812
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,819
A human baby, I'm saying.

813
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,344
Not some-- what do you--

814
00:48:32,518 --> 00:48:34,302
small dog.

815
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:36,739
A puppy.

816
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:38,480
They're called puppies.

817
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:40,918
[laughs]

818
00:48:43,181 --> 00:48:45,183
I know they are called...

819
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,363
Listen, shit-for-brains,

820
00:48:51,537 --> 00:48:55,193
this-- your little powwows

821
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:57,195
with the consigliere--

822
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:59,371
that's over.

823
00:49:01,242 --> 00:49:03,288
You're not listening,

824
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:05,420
so we are gonna stop talking.

825
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:21,480
Give some indication you
understand the English language.

826
00:49:21,654 --> 00:49:23,351
I thought you said

00:17:37,273 --> 00:17:39,232
[horns honking, siren wailing]

293
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:00,079
[entry bell jingles]

294
00:18:10,176 --> 00:18:12,526
-You had a close call.
-Hmm?

295
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,963
-Is what I heard.
-Oh.

296
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:18,706
Yet cooler heads prevailed.

297
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:21,230
-Here you are.
-I think

298
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:23,537
some flapjacks
this morning, Nadine.

299
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:25,713
You got it.

300
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:29,499
-I'll take this.
-No, that's all right.

301
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,545
-Okay.
-You're not eating?

302
00:18:31,719 --> 00:18:33,373
I'm not saying

303
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:37,072
it wasn't a smart play,
moving on the slaughterhouses.

304
00:18:37,246 --> 00:18:39,901
But you must've knew
it wouldn't stick.

305
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:42,991
Well, he gave permission,
the old man.

306
00:18:43,165 --> 00:18:44,514
Last week at the playground.

307
00:18:44,688 --> 00:18:46,299
[scoffs]

308
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,041
Well, you tell me one thing

309
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:51,391
ever got given to you
in this world

310
00:18:51,565 --> 00:18:53,567
that you didn't have to take.
Hmm?

311
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:55,308
And I'm saying...

312
00:18:56,744 --> 00:18:58,702
...respect the deal.

313
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:06,319
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

314
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:11,541
You didn't serve in the war,
did you?

315
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,588
[grunts]

316
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:16,590
I was in the legal corps.

317
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,201
Army. Pushing papers.

318
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:21,247
After the cease-fire,

319
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:24,598
they send me to Nuremberg
for the trials.

320
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:28,036
Last Negro in Germany,
I'd imagine.

321
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,603
Mm-hmm.

322
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:32,910
You ever heard of the Double V?

323
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:35,043
Hmm.

324
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:37,045
It's what they sold us.

325
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,742
Mm-hmm.

326
00:19:38,916 --> 00:19:41,267
Fight for our country,
and we get two victories.

327
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:44,618
One for America and one
for we sons of servitude.

328
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,054
No more lynchings.

329
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,622
No more blackjacks at the polls.

330
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,972
Hmm? Okay.

331
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:54,584
So, they send me to Nuremberg,

332
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:56,630
and this colonel tells me

333
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,980
he's got a big job for me.

334
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:02,592
Says, "You're gonna interview
Hermann Goring,

335
00:20:02,766 --> 00:20:04,942
the Reichsmarschall himself."

336
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,597
Says, "Days, weeks,

337
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,991
however long it takes
to get him to talk."

338
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:13,603
Says, "I need you,
Doctor Senator, Esquire,

339
00:20:13,777 --> 00:20:17,433
"to use your training,
your skills

340
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:20,958
to build the People's case."

341
00:20:21,132 --> 00:20:23,004
Well, now,

342
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:25,093
what is that
if not the double victory?

343
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,008
Hmm?

344
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:30,011
So I sit with the man
for six weeks,

345
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,970
eight hours a day,
six days a week,

346
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:34,972
and we get into it.

347
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:37,627
The first two weeks,

348
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,978
he just stares at me,
murder in his eyes.

349
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:43,024
But I use my wiles.

350
00:20:43,198 --> 00:20:45,635
You know, appeal to his ego.

351
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,028
Get him talking.

352
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:50,640
Ah. Soon he won't shut up.

353
00:20:50,814 --> 00:20:52,642
Bragging
about every little thing,

354
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:54,644
and I type it down
and write it up for the colonel,

355
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,690
word-for-word.

356
00:20:56,864 --> 00:20:58,822
I spend two weeks
crafting my conclusion,

357
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:01,521
my analysis
of international law.

358
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,653
Then, one Sunday morning,

359
00:21:03,827 --> 00:21:06,308
after services,

360
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,528
I knock on the colonel's door

361
00:21:08,702 --> 00:21:11,357
and I give him my report.

362
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,839
You know what he does?

363
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,146
Throws it in the trash.

364
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,192
Yeah.

365
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:24,848
400 pages with footnotes.

366
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:28,722
Throws it in the trash
and says...

367
00:21:28,896 --> 00:21:31,159
"I just wanted to make

368
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:33,683
that old Nazi squirm..."

369
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:38,340
"...having to answer
to a Negro."

370
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,738
So...

371
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:48,089
you say respect the deal?

372
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,659
[silverware clatters]

373
00:21:54,095 --> 00:21:57,272
Excuse me if I say

374
00:21:57,446 --> 00:22:00,406
our word is exactly
as good as yours.

375
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:11,852
The slaughterhouses--
they belong to us.

376
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,421
Deal or no deal.

377
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,077
You can call it the cost
of transition.

378
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:24,430
I'll pass it on.

379
00:22:34,483 --> 00:22:36,616
MILLIGAN:
There's no mystery to it.

380
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:40,315
Everything breaks, and there's
a right way to fix it.

381
00:22:42,448 --> 00:22:44,450
Are you Jewish?

382
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,236
No.

383
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,283
Then how come
they call you Rabbi?

384
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:54,808
Isn't rabbi a Jewish priest?

385
00:22:56,157 --> 00:22:58,115
You ever play poker?

386
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:03,904
But you know there's a game
called poker, played with cards.

387
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:09,300
Well, there's this saying
in poker:

388
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,738
you play the hand you're dealt.

389
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:16,395
You and me, we're proof of that.

390
00:23:20,703 --> 00:23:24,054
You see, when yours truly
was a boy,

391
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:26,361
he had the same thing happen
to him, what happened to you.

392
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:31,322
SATCHEL:
You got traded?

393
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:32,802
What?

394
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,804
From baseball.

395
00:23:34,978 --> 00:23:36,327
That's what my daddy said.

396
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,852
I got traded to another team.

397
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,813
Exactly.

398
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,034
I got traded twice.

399
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,865
Except, well, for you,
you get to go back

400
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:54,824
to your original team one day.

401
00:23:56,652 --> 00:23:57,697
Is this your original team?

402
00:23:57,871 --> 00:23:58,698
No.

403
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,830
My team was shite.

404

[door opens]

405
00:24:15,192 --> 00:24:17,238
What are these words?

406
00:24:18,195 --> 00:24:19,501
Team, traded?

407
00:24:19,675 --> 00:24:20,981
It's nothing.

408
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:22,809
Doesn't matter.

409
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:25,681
Say it again.

410
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:27,248
I want to... I want to hear.

411
00:24:27,422 --> 00:24:29,380
-Yeah.
-We'll get out of your way.

412
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:33,472
[Gaetano laughs]

413
00:24:34,951 --> 00:24:38,215
This was our home in Italy,
my country.

414
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,522
Yeah.
[chuckles]

415
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,219
The fascists knock it down,

416
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:44,744
and so I live in the trees.

417
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,746
[chuckles]

418
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,225

00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:54,405
[chuckles]

420
00:25:00,586 --> 00:25:03,502
So... you're Irish, hmm?

421
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,592
American.

422
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:08,724
I'm American.

423
00:25:11,031 --> 00:25:14,034
[sighs]

424
00:25:16,602 --> 00:25:18,865
But you came to us
when you were just a boy.

425
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:26,873
And you killed
your own father...

426
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:29,049
for us.

427
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,269
What's that like?

428
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:42,584
[gunshot]

429
00:25:42,758 --> 00:25:44,107
Who remembers?

430
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,153
"Who remembers?"
I like it.

431
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:48,111
[Gaetano chuckles]

432
00:25:49,156 --> 00:25:51,288
What the fuck is this?

433
00:25:53,464 --> 00:25:55,075
I got it.

434
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,644
A trade, yeah?

435
00:25:58,818 --> 00:26:01,821
You, Rabbi, for you.

436
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:02,822
Hmm.

437
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:04,432
Come on, kid.

438
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:06,086
Get out of my chair.

439
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,958
No.

440
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,657
I like it.

441
00:26:11,831 --> 00:26:13,615
It's too big for you, no?

442
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,748
Up.

443
00:26:22,537 --> 00:26:24,800
Did you make trouble at
the slaughterhouse last night?

444
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,933
Who, me?

445
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:29,588
I take care of things.

446
00:26:29,762 --> 00:26:31,981
I'm the boss, I'm the one
who takes care of things.

447
00:26:32,155 --> 00:26:35,115
[Gaetano laughing]

448
00:26:37,117 --> 00:26:38,509
You?

449
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:42,165
You can't even take care
of this doctor

450
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:44,864
who kicks our family
out on the street.

451
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,344
What'd you say to me?

452
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:48,781
-You can't even take care of...
-[Satchel sneezes]

453
00:26:50,696 --> 00:26:52,001
Why is he in here?

454
00:26:52,175 --> 00:26:53,524
-This is my office.
-My mistake.

455
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,178
Your man asked me
to fix the radiator.

456
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,353
I...

457
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:58,834
There's secret stuff here.

458
00:26:59,008 --> 00:26:59,835
And he's a...

459
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:01,402
Think.

460
00:27:01,576 --> 00:27:03,360
Retard, use your head next time.

461
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:04,710
And you.

462
00:27:04,884 --> 00:27:06,146
You think I can't take care

463
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,190
of some piece-of-shit
pencil pusher?

464
00:27:07,364 --> 00:27:08,844
Is that what you think?!

465
00:27:09,018 --> 00:27:10,716
Mm-hmm.

466
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,196
Get out.

467
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,024
All of you.

468
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:24,077
You follow orders.

469
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:26,253
You hear me?
Or go home.

470
00:27:27,602 --> 00:27:29,560
What are you doing?
Put that back.

471
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:33,695
[clicks tongue]

472
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,572
[whispering]:
Look at this fucking mess.

473
00:27:46,534 --> 00:27:48,362
It's not too big.

474
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,538

00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,599
Come in while I get cleaned up.

229
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,395
I'm usually oh, so organized,

230
00:19:39,569 --> 00:19:41,528
but, well, these days my mind's

231
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:45,401
like a little bird,
a million miles away.

232
00:19:45,575 --> 00:19:48,056
Oh, I've been reading about
the kings of Egypt.

233
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,624
Pharaohs, they're called.

234
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,323
Like that King Tut they found
living inside a pyramid.

235
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,370
He's a mummy, so...

236
00:19:57,544 --> 00:20:00,155
dead, I think.

237
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,896
Of course.
Yeah.

238
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,247
Well, no, he wasn't "living in,"
he was laying in.

239
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:08,163
Why, sometimes my mouth
says just the strangest things.

240
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,773
Oh, shoot.
I've got to fly.

241
00:20:09,947 --> 00:20:11,558
Now, will you just
put some things away,

242
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:13,560
so that when I come home tonight
I don't feel like

243
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,866
jumping out the window
with everything such a jumble?

244
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,565
Uh, do you want me
to wash these dishes?

245
00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:20,741
Oh, would you?
That'd be swell.

246
00:20:20,915 --> 00:20:23,918
Oh, and while you're at it,
my room's just down the hallway.

247
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:27,226
So if you're doing dishes, you
might as well clean the sheets.

248
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,663
[quietly]:
Sheets.

249
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,754
[door creaks, closes]

250
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,019
-What's in there?
-Oh, never you mind about that.

251
00:20:38,193 --> 00:20:39,586
Now, like I said,

252
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,110
there's, uh, there's
French-playing records

253
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,721
just by the hi-fi, and, uh,

254
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:47,898
yeah, you can borrow
any book you like.

255
00:20:48,072 --> 00:20:49,813
How much?

256
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,250
How much what?

257
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,469
The way I see it,
this whole place--

258
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:56,211
sheets, dishes,
three hours' work--

259
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,213
that's at least a dollar.

260
00:20:59,736 --> 00:21:02,696
Well, aren't you
a little capitalist.

261
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,095
[Antoon snoring]

262
00:21:13,663 --> 00:21:15,578
Hey.

263
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,667
What the hell
are you doing here?

264
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:19,713
I got to tell you something.

265
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,889
What?

266
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:27,111
You're gonna hear talk,
about me,

267
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,940
something I did
or maybe didn't do.

268
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:31,725
Shining a bad light, I mean.

269
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:33,683
Just be aware of whose lips
are doing the flapping.

270
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,642
You being a fink? It sounds like
you're being a fink.

271
00:21:35,816 --> 00:21:38,253
-I botched a hit.
-You botched... How's that?

272
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,996
The Cannon boy.
Lemuel.

273
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:44,346
Calamita said get in the car,
so I got in the car.

274
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,174
We tailed the kid.
He said light him up.

275
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,871
I'm sinking my teeth
into your jugular

276
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,264
-if this story ends with...
-No, no, no. It don't.

277
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,658
Like I said,
he told me to open up,

278
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,660
but events didn't feel right.

279
00:21:53,834 --> 00:21:55,618
"On whose authority?" I ask him,

280
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:58,055
but he don't say,
so I laid on the kibosh.

281
00:21:58,229 --> 00:22:00,057
But the kid saw my fangs,
no doubt.

282
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,668
And look, look,
if you ordered it,

283
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,496
I got no problem
accepting consequence.

284
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,149
But I know you don't want
to start a war.

285
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,021
I didn't order a goddamn hit!

286
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,155
So you're saying what?
Gaetano?

287
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,810
You're telling me that porkpie,
ziti-eating greaser

288
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,638
is giving my boys orders now?

289
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:18,119
That sticky golem wop.

290
00:22:18,293 --> 00:22:19,468
[grunts]

291
00:22:19,642 --> 00:22:21,862
Gotta be kidding me.
[grunts]

292
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:24,995
[grunts]

293
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:27,041
[exhales]

294
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,221
-[whistles]
-[grunts]

295
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,266
-Look. Here.
-[engine starts]

296
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:37,747
You're a good boy.
Reliable.

297
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,183
-You're with me, right?
-Mm-hmm.

298
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,577
All right.
You're gonna watch 'em.

299
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,449
-Who?
-All of 'em.

300
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:45,320
You're like a fucking bird
on a wire, got me?

301
00:22:45,494 --> 00:22:46,495
Eyes in the back of your head.

302
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:48,671
What about Calamita?

303
00:22:48,845 --> 00:22:51,718
Uh, don't worry, he'll get his.

304
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:53,415
It's a new day.
Got me?

305
00:22:53,589 --> 00:22:54,938
Spring fucking cleaning.

306
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,680
You're either loyal,
or you're with him.

307
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,205
Find that cop, Odis.

308
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,686
Tell him to come to the club,
rapid fire.

309
00:23:13,348 --> 00:23:15,176
[car door closes]

310
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,569
[car departs]

311
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:21,400
That's right.
The Pump and Go out on Route 16.

312
00:23:21,574 --> 00:23:23,619
I'm the nightman.

313
00:23:23,793 --> 00:23:26,361
You might tell the marshal
what you told me.

314
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:29,712
About the lesbians?

315
00:23:29,886 --> 00:23:31,279
Well, there was two of them.

316
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:34,238
Uh, a injun
and-and a colored woman.

317
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:37,111
And they were conversing.

318
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,243
Y-Yes, sir, that's correct.

319
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:43,552
About?

320
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,299
I'm asking what was the nature
of the exchange?

321
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:54,302
Oh.
Uh, just, uh...

322
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:56,565
normal chitchat.

323
00:23:57,653 --> 00:23:59,525
See, I th-thought you said

324
00:23:59,699 --> 00:24:02,441
they were talking about
skipping town.

325
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,140
When you called me.

326
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,491
Right. Yeah.
Skipping town.

327
00:24:09,665 --> 00:24:10,927
That's affirmative.

328
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:13,147
Uh, said they was headed
to Chicago.

329
00:24:13,321 --> 00:24:14,801
Chicago?

330
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:17,368
Yes, sir.
Chicago.

331
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:20,067
S-Said they was on their way.

332
00:24:21,111 --> 00:24:22,635
There it is.

333
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:25,072
Guess they flew the coop.
[chuckles]

334
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:31,644
[sighs]

335
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:37,650
I'll, uh, I'll walk you out.

336
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,698
Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Sinclair.

337
00:24:42,872 --> 00:24:46,354
-What's this?
-Don't be an idiot.

338
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:48,487
[knocking and grunting
rhythmically]

339
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,318
Least I know how to open
a damn door.

340
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:08,855
Guess you're off
to Chicago, then, buddy.

341
00:25:09,029 --> 00:25:11,205
That's too bad. We were just
starting to hit it off.

342
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:12,598
Funny story.

343
00:25:13,642 --> 00:25:15,165
What?

344
00:25:15,339 --> 00:25:17,167
We're a national agency,
turns out.

345
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:18,821
The U.S. Marshal Service.

346
00:25:18,995 --> 00:25:20,997
We got offices in Chicago,

347
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,696
Indianapolis, all over.

348
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,480
-[exhales]
-So, I'll pass along the tip,

349
00:25:25,654 --> 00:25:27,003
but Kansas City was my mandate,

350
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:30,224
and Kansas City
is where I'll stay.

351
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:33,270
You know,
in case they circle back.

352
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:35,708
-[stammers]
-[footsteps approaching]

353
00:25:42,845 --> 00:25:44,543
[sharp exhale]

354
00:25:44,717 --> 00:25:47,546
That's fine.
I just thought...

355
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,332
-I got to run an errand.
-An errand?

356
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:53,552
[exhales]

357
00:25:53,726 --> 00:25:56,511
See a snitch, I'm saying.
An informant?

358
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,731
You probably...
We got a code.

359
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:00,646
Well, hell,
why didn't you say so?

360
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,779
-I'll drive.
-That's... D-Don't...

361
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:05,781
don't, don't, don't,
don't trouble yourself.

362
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,523
Amigo, please.
It's the least I can do.

363
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:26,367
You giving orders now?

364
00:26:35,768 --> 00:26:38,292
Calm down.

365
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:40,729
What?

366
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:42,862
[chuckles]

367
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,475
Okay.

368
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:48,998
It's a gunfight, asshole.

369
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,478
[gunshot]

370
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:56,266
What is this--
your little war council?

371
00:27:00,706 --> 00:27:03,404
Boss, I told them
to wait for you.

372
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:04,971
Did you know?

373
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,280
...took a shot at Loy's kid.
Did you know?

374
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:12,718
EBAL: I just found out
from the consigliere.

375
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,853
And you-- you're lucky
my man was there.

376
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:19,202
Or I'd be cutting your throat

377
00:27:19,376 --> 00:27:21,596
with a can of cat food
right now.

378
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:27,863
Ayo.They stole from us.

379
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:30,779
This morning,
these mulignani.Yeah.

380
00:27:30,953 --> 00:27:32,607
300 guns.

381
00:27:36,916 --> 00:27:40,310
Because they think that...
we are weak.

382
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,837
They're right.
You're weak.

383
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,665
You're weak.

384
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,842
You took a shot, you missed.

385
00:27:50,016 --> 00:27:52,148
Now my enemy's got,

386
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:55,021
what, 300 guns?

387
00:27:55,195 --> 00:27:57,371
Congratulations.

388
00:28:04,857 --> 00:28:07,163
Do it.

389
00:28:07,337 --> 00:28:09,209
Please.
Do it.

390
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:15,215
Do it.

391

[sheathes knife]

392
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,149
Bang.

393
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,198
Violante.

[door closes]

397
00:29:07,658 --> 00:29:10,226
It's not his fault.
Come on.

[parking brake clicks]

399
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:41,867
I'll be a minute.

400
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:45,087
[grunting rhythmically]

401
00:29:45,261 --> 00:29:47,220
Is this the minute?

402
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,268
-I could come with.

00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:22,104
I said grab some air!

89
00:05:23,366 --> 00:05:24,585
You boys are breaking the law.

90
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,022
What law?

91
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:28,806
Having too many teeth.

92
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,982
[hisses]

93
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,987
Whoops.

94
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:39,382
What's my money bag doing here
on the floor?

95
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:42,646
Better put this back in the car.

96
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,431
I know you.

97
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,608
No, you don't.

98
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:48,870
[crash]

99
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,654
LOY:
Yeah.

100
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,962
I heard about you.

101
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,791
[crash]

102
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,663
Odis here was in the war.

103
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:01,535
Minesweeper.

104
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:03,972
Every day, take his men...

105
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:08,150
...and hoof it on ahead
of the army,

106
00:06:08,324 --> 00:06:10,326
looking for land mines.

107
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,460
You shut up.

108
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:18,073
Lot of turnover in Odis' unit.

109
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,205
Boom!
There goes Sammy.

110
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,252
Boom!
There goes Mike.

111
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,734
Whole thing started to make
Odis a little twitchy.

112
00:06:26,908 --> 00:06:28,475
Until, one day,

113
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:30,477
he couldn't take it no more.

114
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,305
So he laid down in the grass.

115
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,483
Just looks at the clouds.

116
00:06:38,702 --> 00:06:41,183
Army rolls up.

117
00:06:41,357 --> 00:06:43,315
Colonel says,

118
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,839
"Odis,

119
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:47,145
did you clear this field?"

120
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,365
And Odis says,

121
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:52,194
-"Yes, sir."
-[gasping]

122
00:06:52,368 --> 00:06:53,543
-See...
-I cleared it.

123
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:55,371
Colonel had to take a piss.

124
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:58,505
So he walks out into the field
and...

125
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,073
Boom!

126
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,514
They got to send him home
in a tureen.

127
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,868
That's a pot they put soup in.

128
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,351
[hoarsely]:
Get 'em out of here.

129
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:21,397
Not-not him.

130
00:07:21,571 --> 00:07:23,399
OFFICER:
Get 'em all out. Go.

131
00:07:23,573 --> 00:07:24,879
OFFICER 2:
You heard him.

132
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,713
[stammers, exhales]

133
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,065
You didn't fight in the war,
did you?

134
00:07:37,239 --> 00:07:39,763
Nah, man.

135
00:07:39,937 --> 00:07:43,245
Why would I fight for a country
that wants me dead?

136
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:46,466
[chuckles]
Boom!

137
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:52,646
Josto Fadda says...

138
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,431
stick to the deal.

139
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:00,088
Boom!

[groaning loudly]

ETHELRIDA:
Dear Dr. Harvard...

146
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:14,162
I am writing
to inform you of the actions

147
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:15,685
of one of your nurses.

148
00:09:15,859 --> 00:09:17,034
[knocking]

149
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,209
[door opens]

150
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,646
THURMAN:
Decent?

151
00:09:23,345 --> 00:09:24,520
Lights out.

152
00:09:24,694 --> 00:09:26,522
Big day tomorrow.

153
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:28,132
What?

154
00:09:28,306 --> 00:09:30,395
Your birthday.

155
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,658
Don't tell me you forgot.

156
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:33,355
[exhales]
Yeah.

157
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:36,053
Right, it's a... it's a big day.

158
00:09:36,227 --> 00:09:39,491
Hey, Dad, what...
what's laudanum?

159
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,668
Chemistry homework?

160
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,671
Not exactly.

161
00:09:46,194 --> 00:09:47,021
Well, let's see.

162
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:48,326
Laudanum, it's a...

163
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,111
it's a painkiller.

164
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,155
Real potent.

165
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,722
Is it dangerous?

166
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:56,900
Could be, if you take too much.
Why?

167
00:09:57,074 --> 00:10:00,512
I saw it at Mrs. Mayflower's,
across the way.

168
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,558
Tons.

169
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,866
Well, hon, she is a nurse.

170
00:10:07,432 --> 00:10:08,782
But it's not something
she should be keeping

171
00:10:08,956 --> 00:10:10,392
around the house.

172
00:10:10,566 --> 00:10:12,524
Lights out now, okay?

173
00:10:12,699 --> 00:10:15,049
Okay, Daddy.

174
00:10:18,226 --> 00:10:19,227
Dad.

175
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:24,275
Are we ever gonna
see Aunt Zelmare again?

176
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:28,323
Of course we will.

177
00:10:28,497 --> 00:10:30,455
She's just, you know,

178
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,067
an escaped convict, so...

179
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:34,721
Where'd she go?

180
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,594
She's, um...

181
00:10:38,768 --> 00:10:41,597
Well, I don't know that you
need to know that, young lady.

182
00:10:45,601 --> 00:10:48,082
She's at a residential hotel
downtown, holed up.

183
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:51,172
The New Parie or some such.

184
00:10:51,346 --> 00:10:54,436
But don't you even think of
going down there, you hear me?

185
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:59,093
Okay.

186
00:11:04,794 --> 00:11:06,404
Listen...

187
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,102
this Miss Mayflower.

188
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:10,104
She's...

189
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,280
she's not really...

190
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:15,022
I mean, I'm sure
she's real nice,

191
00:11:15,196 --> 00:11:17,807
but she's not someone
you should be hanging around.

192
00:11:17,981 --> 00:11:19,940
Huh?

193
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,986
We got a real precarious
situation here,

194
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,641
living outside the law and all.

195
00:11:25,815 --> 00:11:27,512
So...

196
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,384
Not to mention,
I think she might've

197
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,429
poisoned that pie she baked us.

198
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,996
Anyway,

199
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,477
steer clear.

200
00:11:35,651 --> 00:11:37,000
All right.

201
00:11:37,174 --> 00:11:39,481

-[groaning]
-[thud]

205
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:12,644
...and felt that I should bring certain actions of hers

206
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:15,256
to your attention.

207
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,346
In the last year,

208
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,522
many of Nurse Mayflower's
patients have died

209
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:23,177

[fanfare plays over radio]

211

NEWSMAN [over radio]:
President Truman,
asking Congress

212
00:12:43,719 --> 00:12:45,634
for strong
anti-inflation laws, says

213
00:12:45,808 --> 00:12:48,593
we must remain strong at home
to beat worldwide communism.

214
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,465
TRUMAN:
And the way to do it is

215
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,858
to have
an anti-inflation program,

216
00:12:52,032 --> 00:12:53,903
including price controls,

217
00:12:54,077 --> 00:12:56,863
wage controls, rent controls,
credit controls--

218
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,908

219
00:12:59,082 --> 00:13:01,215
hold down prices
and the cost of living.

Satchel, tell the boss
what you're working on.

-I'm bad at math.
-Funny.

227
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:21,626
No one ever says
"I'm bad at English."

00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,412
What?

229
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,066
Nothing.

after last night.

there's no war to fight.

00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,475
Would you?

Would you go back?

another city, then.

maybe earlier--

from the old country.

use the help," he'll say,

and they're here to take over.

251
00:14:27,475 --> 00:14:29,956
So what do we do?

Making me say it

instead of you isn't gonna
make doing it any easier.

Plenty of people
are bad at English.

Yeah, but they're not
proud of it.

256

This problem you got--
it's a math problem.

257
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,851
Either you divide them

258
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:58,332
or they multiply.

Be ready.

262
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,181
When the shooting starts,

263
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,010
we vanish.

634
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,779
DIBRELL:
We have some cookies.

635
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:42,521
I-I can get your son
some cookies.

636
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,087
Sit!

637
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:49,528
Does this look like my son?

638
00:37:52,052 --> 00:37:55,577
Does he look like my son?

639
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:58,537
Well...

640
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:03,193
Tell them your name.

641
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:06,458
Zirominu Guglielmo Fadda.

642
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:09,678
I traded for him.

643
00:38:09,852 --> 00:38:11,114
You...

644
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,075
I traded my own son to my enemy
for power.

645
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:18,731
His mama cries herself to sleep
at night, but me?

646
00:38:18,905 --> 00:38:20,080
I sleep like a baby.

647
00:38:20,254 --> 00:38:22,517
You understand?

648
00:38:22,691 --> 00:38:25,738
I will do
whatever it takes to win.

649
00:38:28,915 --> 00:38:30,743
Yes, sir.

650
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,318
Get the boy a piece of cake.

651
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:49,283
[dish clatters]

652
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,791
Your business is mine now.

653
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:21,837
You'll sign over the deed
this afternoon.

654
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,974
Um...

655
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:32,413
Mr. Cannon, p-please.

656
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:35,068
No, no.
We're past "please."

657
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:37,200
Now we're at,
"Whatever you want, boss.

658
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,941
Just don't kill me."

659
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,466
Also, you're gonna tell me
where your sister's at.

660
00:39:42,815 --> 00:39:44,643
Oh, yeah,
I've been doing some asking.

661
00:39:44,817 --> 00:39:47,472
Zelmare Roulette.

662
00:39:47,646 --> 00:39:49,909
[chuckles softly]
Some name.

663
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,172
Her and her butch Indian.

664
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:55,523
They broke out of prison
and now they're here.

665
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,177
Well, I want 'em.

666
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,180
What are you gonna do?

667
00:40:01,268 --> 00:40:03,488
Whatever the fuck I want.

668
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:05,490
-It's my fault.
-Thurman.

669
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:08,057
No.

670
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,669
I should have asked her
where she got the...

671
00:40:10,843 --> 00:40:14,499
But... it's my first time, see?

672
00:40:14,673 --> 00:40:16,675
Owing money to a...

673
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:20,069
And I didn't...

674
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,724
The rules, you know?
What are the rules?

675
00:40:22,898 --> 00:40:26,119
LOY:
The rules are you tell me
what I want to know,

676
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:28,121
or I paint this room with you

677
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,515
and wait for your daughter
to come home.

678
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,742
Okay.

679
00:40:40,916 --> 00:40:42,875
-[school bell rings]
-[indistinct chatter]

680
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:50,056
Well... I'm here.

681
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,927
What's the rumpus?

682
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:55,409
I knew you were trouble
moment I laid eyes on you.

683
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,289
Miss Smutny.

684
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,378
Inside.

685
00:41:08,553 --> 00:41:10,903
Now.

686
00:41:22,436 --> 00:41:25,308
In all my years
of educating colored children,

687
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,572
I never had a U.S. marshal
come to my office

688
00:41:27,746 --> 00:41:29,922
and ask to talk to a student.

689
00:41:31,837 --> 00:41:33,795
You mind giving us a minute?

690
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:40,454
[door opens]

691
00:41:41,847 --> 00:41:43,805
[door closes]

692
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,810
I've been thinking about you.

693
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,074
About me?

694
00:41:52,248 --> 00:41:54,337
Mm-hmm.

695
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,514
Straight A student, I'm told.

696
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:58,516
Speaks a foreign language.

697
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,300
My Lord.

698
00:42:04,696 --> 00:42:07,133
Your aunt, on the other hand--

699
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:09,570
she goes on a cough-syrup bender

700
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:12,573
that ends in the pistol grip
bludgeoning of a pregnant woman

701
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:15,141
and the prayerful execution
of her husband.

702
00:42:15,315 --> 00:42:17,535
An armed robbery
that netted Zelmare Roulette

703
00:42:17,709 --> 00:42:19,798
all of $9.58.

704
00:42:23,845 --> 00:42:26,369
You thought she was in jail
for littering?

705
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:30,983
Oh, and then there's
her paramour, Swanee Capps.

706
00:42:31,157 --> 00:42:33,159
She was the third wheel
on a bank robbery crew

707
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:35,161
that killed a bank manager
father of three

708
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:37,380
and the coach
of a peewee football team.

709
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,513
This is who you're protecting.

710
00:42:42,342 --> 00:42:44,170
I know they're family.

711
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:46,389
And I know there,
on the north side of town,

712
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,783
colored folks talk
about "us versus them"

713
00:42:48,957 --> 00:42:50,611
and "we got to stick together"
and what have you.

714
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:53,483
But if you deem yourself
a civilized person--

715
00:42:53,658 --> 00:42:55,007
and I know you do--

716
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:58,358
you've got to act
in a civilized manner.

717
00:42:58,532 --> 00:43:00,708
End of story.

718
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:02,710
So...

719
00:43:02,884 --> 00:43:05,365
I'm asking.

720
00:43:05,539 --> 00:43:08,194
Where's your auntie at?

721
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:12,198
Civilized?

722
00:43:12,372 --> 00:43:14,374
Mm-hmm.
That's what I said.

723
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:17,072
You know, do you not,
that Africa is

724
00:43:17,246 --> 00:43:19,292
the birthplace of civilization?

725
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:22,208
Which means both
your ancestors and mine

726
00:43:22,382 --> 00:43:24,602
came from the same
green savannah.

727
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,127
I got an A in anthropology.

728
00:43:28,301 --> 00:43:30,216
That's factual.

729
00:43:35,177 --> 00:43:36,701
[laughs]

730
00:43:39,355 --> 00:43:40,705
Fascinating.

731
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:44,622
But...
[laughs]

732
00:43:44,796 --> 00:43:48,060
Listen, I've been mired in
this town going on ten days now,

733
00:43:48,234 --> 00:43:49,583
and I need to get home
to the wife and kids,

734
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,454
so I'll make this simple.

735
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:54,414
Tell me where your aunt is
or I'll get you expelled.

736
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:59,245
-Sir...
-Oh, now it's "sir."

737
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,163
-Please.
-No.

738
00:44:04,337 --> 00:44:07,601
The Lord said shake the tree,
and I'm shaking it.

739
00:44:07,775 --> 00:44:11,170
Your life or hers.
One of 'em's getting ruined.

740
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,955
Which one is up to you.

741
00:44:25,793 --> 00:44:28,100
Boss, let me explain.

742
00:44:28,274 --> 00:44:30,929
Get him home.
His mama's worried sick.

743
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:33,758
You can handle that, right?

744
00:44:33,932 --> 00:44:36,238
Of course I can. I didn't
even want to be in there.

745
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:37,762
Later.

746
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:47,249
Ready to work?

747
00:44:47,423 --> 00:44:49,295
Yes, sir.

748
00:44:49,469 --> 00:44:50,644
We leave in five.

749
00:44:50,818 --> 00:44:52,472
Arm up.

750
00:44:58,608 --> 00:45:00,306
Calling all cars.

751
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,178
Suspect fugitives are holed up
at the New Parie Hotel.

752
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:05,137
I am inbound, requesting backup.

753
00:45:05,311 --> 00:45:06,355
DISPATCHER:
Roger that.

754
00:45:06,529 --> 00:45:08,401
[laughs]

755
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:11,796
I could get used to this.

756
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:14,320
What, masticating savory vittles

757
00:45:14,494 --> 00:45:16,365
and imbibing top-shelf hooch?

758
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:17,845
Hoo-wee!

759
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:20,500
Someone's been studying
their vocabulary.

760
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:23,982
I am trying to be punctilious
with my locution.

761
00:45:24,156 --> 00:45:26,419
Girl, I don't know
what you just said,

762
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:28,377
but I like the way it sound.

763
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:30,510
[both laughing]

764
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:34,514
[Zelmare and Swanee gasp]

765
00:45:34,688 --> 00:45:35,863
OPAL:
Hands.

766
00:45:36,037 --> 00:45:38,170
Ladies.

767
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,478
Cover yourselves up.

768
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:43,915
Never mind that.

769
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:46,265
Let's get this over with.

770
00:45:46,439 --> 00:45:48,223
-LOY: You're the puker?
-[clicks tongue]

771
00:45:48,397 --> 00:45:49,703
So you must be the shooter.

772
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:51,357
Give me my gun,
and I'll show you.

773
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:52,837
LOY:
They got spirit.

774
00:45:53,011 --> 00:45:56,231
God help me,
I love a girl with spirit.

775
00:45:56,405 --> 00:45:57,842
Get dressed.

776
00:46:02,107 --> 00:46:03,673
[car door closes]

777
00:46:03,848 --> 00:46:05,545
SWANEE:
Mister,

778
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:07,765
either rape us
or kill us already.

779
00:46:09,027 --> 00:46:11,203
LOY:
Dying's too easy.

780
00:46:11,377 --> 00:46:14,293
You owe me,
and I'm putting you to work.

781
00:46:14,467 --> 00:46:16,469
-We ain't whores.
-Don't need whores.

782
00:46:16,643 --> 00:46:18,776
Need soldiers,
invisiblesoldiers.

783
00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:21,648
Soldiers the other side
can't see coming.

784
00:46:21,822 --> 00:46:24,129
Who's more invisible than you?

785
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:25,870
DEAFY:
Which room

786
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,350
are the two jailbirds in--
the Negro and the Injun?

787
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:30,570
313.

788
00:46:33,312 --> 00:46:35,096
We don't like bosses.

789
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:38,883
You like bullets?

790
00:46:40,623 --> 00:46:42,582
What do you want us to do?

791
00:46:55,421 --> 00:46:56,596
[car doors close]

00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:00,252
ZELMARE:
Hey, hey,

794
00:47:00,426 --> 00:47:01,340
don't touch me.
Don't touch me!

795
00:47:01,514 --> 00:47:02,471

00:47:10,001 --> 00:47:11,959
Son of a biscuit.

798
00:47:20,098 --> 00:47:21,751
Good afternoon.

799
00:47:21,926 --> 00:47:23,928
Afternoon.

800
00:47:25,103 --> 00:47:27,453
Cup of joe, Doc?

801
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,852
Not today, Nadine.

802
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:55,785
Am I talking to you,

803
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:58,484
or am I talking to him?

804
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,790
Please.
[sniffles]

805
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:02,662
Have a seat.

806
00:48:02,836 --> 00:48:04,838
Where is the consigliere?

807
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,973
Please.

808
00:48:14,152 --> 00:48:16,154
[Calamita laughs]

809
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,898
You ever...

810
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,468
You ever see a baby in a box?

811
00:48:26,642 --> 00:48:27,687
What?

812
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:29,819
A human baby, I'm saying.

813
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,344
